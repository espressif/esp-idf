#   #define SOME_FIELD  0xFFFF
#   #define SOME_FIELD_M  ((SOME_FIELD_V)<<(SOME_FIELD_S))
#   #define SOME_FIELD_V  0xFFFF
#   #define SOME_FIELD_S  16
# here SOME_FIELD_V doesn't have an unsigned (U) prefix, so the compiler flags
# SOME_FIELD_M expansion (0xFFFF << 16) as generating integer overflow.
