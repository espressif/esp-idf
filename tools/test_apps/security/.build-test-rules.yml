tools/test_apps/security/secure_boot:
  enable:
    - if: CONFIG_NAME == "qemu"
      reason: the test can only run on an FPGA as efuses need to be reset during the test.
  disable:
    - if: CONFIG_NAME != "qemu" or IDF_TARGET == "linux"
      reason: Skipping redundant CI builds for all the targets.

tools/test_apps/security/signed_app_no_secure_boot:
  enable:
    - if: IDF_TARGET in ["esp32c2", "esp32c3"]
      temporary: true
      reason: No need to test on all targets
