/*
 * Test backported deletion behavior by creating tasks of various affinities and
 * check if the task memory is freed immediately under the correct conditions.
 *
 * The behavior of vTaskDelete() results in the immediate freeing of task memory
 * and the immediate execution of deletion callbacks for tasks which are not
 * running, provided they are not pinned to the other core (due to FPU cleanup
 * requirements).
 *
 * If the condition is not met, freeing of task memory and execution of
 * deletion callbacks will still be carried out by the Idle Task.
