#     re: Regular expression of error to search
#     hint: The message of the hint. Optionally, it is possible to use '{}' at the place where the matched group from 're' should be inserted. This requires 'match_to_output: True'. You can use variables with hint messages. For this, you need to add variables and "{}" in a place where you want to put your hint variable, but you can't use 'match_to_output' with variables.
#     match_to_output: (False by default) see the description of 'hint'.
#     variables:
#       -
#           re_variables: [set variable for regular expression]
#           hint_variables: [set variable for hint]
# Rules to write regex for hints on how to resolve errors
# - Do not use more than one whitespace in a row. The script automatically merges several whitespaces into one when capturing output
# - Do not use \n in your regex. They are all automatically deletes by the script when capturing output
