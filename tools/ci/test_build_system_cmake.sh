#
# Test the build system for basic consistency (Cmake/idf.py version)
#
# A bash script that tests some likely build failure scenarios in a row
#
# Assumes PWD is an out-of-tree build directory, and will create a
# subdirectory inside it to run build tests in.
#
# Environment variables:
# IDF_PATH - must be set
# ESP_IDF_TEMPLATE_GIT - Can override git clone source for template app. Otherwise github.
# NOCLEANUP - Set to '1' if you want the script to leave its temporary directory when done, for post-mortem.
#
#
# Internals:
# * The tests run in sequence & the system keeps track of all failures to print at the end.
# * BUILD directory is set to default BUILD_DIR_BASE
# * The "print_status" function both prints a status line to the log and keeps track of which test is running.
# * Calling the "failure" function prints a failure message to the log and also adds to the list of failures to print at the end.
# * The function "assert_built" tests for a file relative to the BUILD directory.
# * The function "take_build_snapshot" can be paired with the functions "assert_rebuilt" and "assert_not_rebuilt" to compare file timestamps and verify if they were rebuilt or not since the snapshot was taken.
#
# To add a new test case, add it to the end of the run_tests function. Note that not all test cases do comprehensive cleanup
# (although very invasive ones like appending CRLFs to all files take a copy of the esp-idf tree), however the clean_build_dir
# function can be used to force-delete all files from the build output directory.

# Set up some variables
#
# override ESP_IDF_TEMPLATE_GIT to point to a local dir if you're testing and want fast iterations
