# This file configures the check_copyright pre-commit hook
#
# Values from the DEFAULT section are used, when the particular option is not set in a section.
# The DEFAULT section also contains all options with description
#
# Section name is just an identifier, keep it unique.
# Section must contain the option 'include' and at least one other option
#
# The sections are matched in the order they are in this config file, the last section which matches is used.
# This means that the order of the sections should be from broad to specific.
# For example:
# sections:
#   tools/
#   tools/ci/file.c
#   tools/ci/
# files:
# tools/file.c -> section tools/
# tools/ci/file.c -> section tools/ci/
#

# don't modify this section!
DEFAULT:
  perform_check: yes  # should the check be performed?
  # Sections setting this to 'no' don't need to include any other options as they are ignored
  # When a file is using a section with the option set to 'no', no checks are performed.

  # what licenses (or license expressions) are allowed for files in this section
  # when setting this option in a section, you need to list all the allowed licenses
