# This is a helper script for detecting Python executables in the PATH. It is intended to be used for determining
# which Python should be used with idf_tools.py for installing tools and exporting environment variables.
#
# 1. The script is looking for python version same or greater than minimal required version on path
# 2. If required version of python is found it is assigned to environmental variable `ESP_PYTHON`
# 3. If required version of python is not found, script will fail
