# Project for testing the IDF monitor

Use `run_test_idf_monitor.py` in order to run the test.

New tests can be added into `test_list` of `run_test_idf_monitor.py` and placing the corresponding files into the
`tests` directory.

Note: The `idf_monitor` is tested by a dummy ELF file which was generated by running the following commands::

    dd if=/dev/zero of=tmp.bin bs=1 count=4
    xtensa-esp32-elf-objcopy -I binary -O elf32-xtensa-le -B xtensa tmp.bin tmp.o
    xtensa-esp32-elf-ld --defsym _start=0x40000000 tmp.o -o dummy.elf
    chmod -x dummy.elf
