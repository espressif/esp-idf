    help
        Some ESP32s have Two Point calibration values burned into eFuse BLOCK3.
        This option will allow the ADC calibration component to characterize the
        ADC-Voltage curve using Two Point values if they are available.

config ADC_CAL_EFUSE_VREF_ENABLE
    bool "Use eFuse Vref"
    default "y"
    help
        Some ESP32s have Vref burned into eFuse BLOCK0. This option will allow 
        the ADC calibration component to characterize the ADC-Voltage curve using 
        eFuse Vref if it is available.

config ADC_CAL_LUT_ENABLE
    bool "Use Lookup Tables"
    default "y"
    help
        This option will allow the ADC calibration component to use Lookup Tables
        to correct for non-linear behavior in 11db attenuation. Other attenuations
        do not exhibit non-linear behavior hence will not be affected by this option.
