            Ensure the I2S interrupt is IRAM-Safe by allowing the interrupt handler to be
            executable when the cache is disabled (e.g. SPI Flash write).

            Force fractional part of clock divisor to known value.
            This seems to help reducing noise.

            whether to enable the debug log message for I2S driver.
            Note that, this option only controls the I2S driver log, will not affect other drivers.
