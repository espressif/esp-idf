            Ensure the I2S interrupt is IRAM-Safe by allowing the interrupt handler to be
            executable when the cache is disabled (e.g. SPI Flash write).

            Place I2S control functions into IRAM,
            so that these functions can be IRAM-safe and able to be called in the other IRAM interrupt context.

            whether to enable the debug log message for I2S driver.
            Note that, this option only controls the I2S driver log, will not affect other drivers.
