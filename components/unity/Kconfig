        bool "Support for float type"
        default y
        help
            If not set, assertions on float arguments will not be available.

        bool "Include ESP-IDF test registration/running helpers"
        default y
        help
            If set, then the following features will be available:

            - TEST_CASE macro which performs automatic registration of test functions
            - Functions to run registered test functions: unity_run_all_tests,
              unity_run_tests_with_filter, unity_run_single_test_by_name.
            - Interactive menu which lists test cases and allows choosing the tests to
              be run, available via unity_run_menu function.

            Disable if a different test registration mechanism is used.

    config UNITY_ENABLE_FIXTURE

            If set, unity_fixture.h header file and associated source files are part of

            implement test groups.

    config UNITY_ENABLE_BACKTRACE_ON_FAIL

            jumping back to the test menu. The jumping is usually occurs in assert
            functions such as TEST_ASSERT, TEST_FAIL etc.
