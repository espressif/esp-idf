            Normally only the ISR of SPI master is placed in the IRAM, so that it
            can work without the flash when interrupt is triggered.
            For other functions, there's some possibility that the flash cache
            miss when running inside and out of SPI functions, which may increase
            the interval of SPI transactions.
            Enable this to put ``queue_trans``, ``get_trans_result`` and
            ``transmit`` functions into the IRAM to avoid possible cache miss.

            This configuration won't be available if `CONFIG_FREERTOS_PLACE_FUNCTIONS_INTO_FLASH` is enabled.

            During unit test, this is enabled to measure the ideal case of api.

            Place the SPI master ISR in to IRAM to avoid possible cache miss.

            Enabling this configuration is possible only when HEAP_PLACE_FUNCTION_INTO_FLASH
            is disabled since the spi master uses can allocate transactions buffers into DMA
            memory section using the heap component API that ipso facto has to be placed in IRAM.

            Also you can forbid the ISR being disabled during flash writing
            access, by add ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM when initializing the driver.
