    config ESP_HTTP_CLIENT_ENABLE_HTTPS
        bool "Enable https"
        default y
        help
            This option will enable https protocol by linking esp-tls library and initializing SSL transport

    config ESP_HTTP_CLIENT_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH
        bool "Enable HTTP Basic Authentication"
        default n
        help
            This option will enable HTTP Basic Authentication. It is disabled by default as Basic
            auth uses unencrypted encoding, so it introduces a vulnerability when not using TLS

    config ESP_HTTP_CLIENT_ENABLE_DIGEST_AUTH
        bool "Enable HTTP Digest Authentication"
        default n
        help
            This option will enable HTTP Digest Authentication. It is enabled by default, but use of this
            configuration is not recommended as the password can be derived from the exchange, so it introduces
            a vulnerability when not using TLS

    config ESP_HTTP_CLIENT_ENABLE_CUSTOM_TRANSPORT
        bool "Enable custom transport"
        default n
        help
            This option will enable injection of a custom tcp_transport handle, so the http operation
            will be performed on top of the user defined transport abstraction (if configured)

    config ESP_HTTP_CLIENT_EVENT_POST_TIMEOUT
        int "Time in millisecond to wait for posting event"
        default 2000
        help
            This config option helps in setting the time in millisecond to wait for event to be posted to the
            system default event loop. Set it to -1 if you need to set timeout to portMAX_DELAY.
