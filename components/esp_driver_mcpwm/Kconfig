            This will ensure the MCPWM interrupt handle is IRAM-Safe, allow to avoid flash
            cache misses, and also be able to run whilst the cache is disabled.
            (e.g. SPI Flash write)

    config MCPWM_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM
        bool "Place MCPWM control functions into IRAM"
        default n
        help
            Place MCPWM control functions (like set_compare_value) into IRAM,
            so that these functions can be IRAM-safe and able to be called in the other IRAM interrupt context.
            Enabling this option can improve driver performance as well.

    config MCPWM_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG
        bool "Enable debug log"
        default n
        help
            Wether to enable the debug log message for MCPWM driver.
            Note that, this option only controls the MCPWM driver log, won't affect other drivers.
