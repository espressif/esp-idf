 * @param fat_drive  FATFS drive specification; if only one drive is used, can be an empty string
 * @param max_files  maximum number of files which can be open at the same time
 * @param[out] out_fs  pointer to FATFS structure which can be used for FATFS f_mount call is returned via this argument.
