Overview:

The TinyCrypt Library provides an implementation for constrained devices of a
minimal set of standard cryptography primitives.

Please, ***SEE THE DOCUMENTATION*** folder for more information on the supported
cryptographic primitives and the limitations of TinyCrypt library. For usage,
security and technicalities, please see the corresponding header file of each
cryptographic primitive.

================================================================================

Organization:

/lib: C source code of the cryptographic primitives.
/lib/include/tinycrypt: C header files of the cryptographic primitives.
/tests: Test vectors of the cryptographic primitives.
/doc: Documentation of TinyCrypt.

================================================================================

Building:

1) In Makefile.conf set:
    - CFLAGS for compiler flags.
    - CC for compiler.
    - ENABLE_TESTS for enabling (true) or disabling (false) tests compilation.
2) In lib/Makefile select the primitives required by your project.
3) In tests/Makefile select the corresponding tests of the selected primitives.
4) make
5) run tests in tests/
