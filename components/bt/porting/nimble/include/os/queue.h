/*
 * This file defines circular queues. The other types of data structures:
 * singly-linked lists, singly-linked tail queues, lists and tail queues
 * are used from sys/queue.h
 *
 * A singly-linked list is headed by a single forward pointer. The elements
 * are singly linked for minimum space and pointer manipulation overhead at
 * the expense of O(n) removal for arbitrary elements. New elements can be
 * added to the list after an existing element or at the head of the list.
 * Elements being removed from the head of the list should use the explicit
 * macro for this purpose for optimum efficiency. A singly-linked list may
 * only be traversed in the forward direction.  Singly-linked lists are ideal
 * for applications with large datasets and few or no removals or for
 * implementing a LIFO queue.
 *
 * A singly-linked tail queue is headed by a pair of pointers, one to the
 * head of the list and the other to the tail of the list. The elements are
 * singly linked for minimum space and pointer manipulation overhead at the
 * expense of O(n) removal for arbitrary elements. New elements can be added
 * to the list after an existing element, at the head of the list, or at the
 * end of the list. Elements being removed from the head of the tail queue
 * should use the explicit macro for this purpose for optimum efficiency.
 * A singly-linked tail queue may only be traversed in the forward direction.
 * Singly-linked tail queues are ideal for applications with large datasets
 * and few or no removals or for implementing a FIFO queue.
 *
 * A list is headed by a single forward pointer (or an array of forward
 * pointers for a hash table header). The elements are doubly linked
 * so that an arbitrary element can be removed without a need to
 * traverse the list. New elements can be added to the list before
 * or after an existing element or at the head of the list. A list
 * may only be traversed in the forward direction.
 *
 * A tail queue is headed by a pair of pointers, one to the head of the
 * list and the other to the tail of the list. The elements are doubly
 * linked so that an arbitrary element can be removed without a need to
 * traverse the list. New elements can be added to the list before or
 * after an existing element, at the head of the list, or at the end of
 * the list. A tail queue may be traversed in either direction.
 *
 * A circle queue is headed by a pair of pointers, one to the head of the
 * list and the other to the tail of the list. The elements are doubly
 * linked so that an arbitrary element can be removed without a need to
 * traverse the list. New elements can be added to the list before or after
 * an existing element, at the head of the list, or at the end of the list.
 * A circle queue may be traversed in either direction, but has a more
 * complex end of list detection.
 *
 * For details on the use of these macros, see the queue(3) manual page.
