            This option release Bluetooth text section and merge Bluetooth data, bss & text into
            a large free heap region when esp_bt_mem_release is called, total saving ~21kB or more of IRAM.
            ESP32-C2 only 3 configurable PMP entries available, rest of them are hard-coded.
            We cannot split the memory into 3 different regions (IRAM, BLE-IRAM, DRAM).
            So this option will disable the PMP (ESP_SYSTEM_PMP_IDRAM_SPLIT)
