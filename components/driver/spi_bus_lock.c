/*
 * This lock is designed to solve the conflicts between SPI devices (used in tasks) and
 * the background operations (ISR or cache access).
 *
 * There are N (device/task) + 1 (BG) acquiring processer candidates that may touch the bus.
 *
 * The core of the lock is a `status` atomic variable, which is always available. No intermediate
 * status is allowed. The atomic operations (mainly `atomic_fetch_and`, `atomic_fetch_or`)
 * atomically read the status, and bitwisely write status value ORed / ANDed with given masks.
 *
 * Definitions of the status:
 * - [30]    WEAK_BG_FLAG, active when the BG is the cache
 * - [29:20] LOCK bits, active when corresponding device is asking for acquiring
 * - [19:10] PENDING bits, active when the BG acknowledges the REQ bits, but hasn't fully handled them.
 * - [ 9: 0] REQ bits, active when corresponding device is requesting for BG operations.
 *
 *   The REQ bits together PENDING bits are called BG bits, which represent the actual BG request
 *   state of devices. Either one of REQ or PENDING being active indicates the device has pending BG
 *   requests. Reason of having two bits instead of one is in the appendix below.
 *
 * Acquiring processer means the current processor (task or ISR) allowed to touch the critical
 * resources, or the SPI bus.
 *
 * States of the lock:
 * - STATE_IDLE: There's no acquiring processor. No device is acquiring the bus, and no BG
 *   operation is in progress.
 *
 * - STATE_ACQ: The acquiring processor is a device task. This means one of the devices is
 *   acquiring the bus.
 *
 * - STATE_BG: The acquiring processor is the ISR, and there is no acquiring device.
 *
 * - STATE_BG_ACQ: The acquiring processor is the ISR, and there is an acquiring device.
 *
 *
 * Whenever a bit is written to the status, it means the a device on a task is trying to acquire
 * the lock (either for the task, or the ISR). When there is no LOCK bits or BG bits active, the
 * caller immediately become the acquiring processor. Otherwise, the task has to block, and the ISR
 * will not be invoked until scheduled by the current acquiring processor.
 *
 * The acquiring processor is responsible to assign the next acquiring processor by calling the
 * scheduler, usually after it finishes some requests, and cleared the corresponding status bit.
 * But there is one exception, when the last bit is cleared from the status, after which there is
 * no other LOCK bits or BG bits active, the acquiring processor lost its role immediately, and
 * don't need to call the scheduler to assign the next acquiring processor.
 *
 * The acquiring processor may also choose to assign a new acquiring device when there is no, by
 * calling `spi_bus_lock_bg_rotate_acq_dev` in the ISR. But the acquiring processor, in this case,
 * is still the ISR, until it calls the scheduler.
 *
 *
 * Transition of the FSM:
 *
 * - STATE_IDLE: no acquiring device, nor acquiring processor, no LOCK or BG bits active
 *   -> STATE_BG: by `req_core`
 *   -> STATE_ACQ: by `acquire_core`
 *
 * - STATE_BG:
 *      * No acquiring device, the ISR is the acquiring processor, there is BG bits active, but no LOCK
 *        bits
 *      * The BG operation should be enabled while turning into this state.
 *
 *   -> STATE_IDLE: by `bg_exit_core` after `clear_pend_core` for all BG bits
 *   -> STATE_BG_ACQ: by `schedule_core`, when there is new LOCK bit set (by `acquire_core`)
 *
 * - STATE_BG_ACQ:
 *      * There is acquiring device, the ISR is the acquiring processor, there may be BG bits active for
 *        the acquiring device.
 *      * The BG operation should be enabled while turning into this state.
 *
 *   -> STATE_ACQ: by `bg_exit_core` after `clear_pend_core` for all BG bits for the acquiring
 *                 device.
 *
 *                 Should not go to the STATE_ACQ (unblock the acquiring task) until all requests of the
 *                 acquiring device are finished. This is to preserve the sequence of foreground (polling) and
 *                 background operations of the device. The background operations queued before the acquiring
 *                 should be completed first.
 *
 * - STATE_ACQ:
 *      * There is acquiring device, the task is the acquiring processor, there is no BG bits active for
 *        the acquiring device.
 *      * The acquiring task (if blocked at `spi_bus_lock_acquire_start` or `spi_bus_lock_wait_bg_done`)
 *        should be resumed while turning into this state.
 *
 *   -> STATE_BG_ACQ: by `req_core`
 *   -> STATE_BG_ACQ (other device): by `acquire_end_core`, when there is LOCK bit for another
 *                    device, and the new acquiring device has active BG bits.
 *   -> STATE_ACQ (other device): by `acquire_end_core`, when there is LOCK bit for another devices,
 *                    but the new acquiring device has no active BG bits.
 *   -> STATE_BG: by `acquire_end_core` when there is no LOCK bit active, but there are active BG
 *                bits.
 *   -> STATE_IDLE: by `acquire_end_core` when there is no LOCK bit, nor BG bit active.
 *
 * The `req_core` used in the task is a little special. It asks for acquiring processor for the
 * ISR. When it succeed for the first time, it will invoke the ISR (hence passing the acquiring
 * role to the BG). Otherwise it will not block, the ISR will be automatically be invoked by other
 * acquiring processor. The caller of `req_core` will never become acquiring processor by this
 * function.
 *
 *
 * Appendix: The design, that having both request bit and pending bit, is to solve the
 * concurrency issue between tasks and the bg, when the task can queue several requests,
 * however the request bit cannot represent the number of requests queued.
 *
 * Here's the workflow of task and ISR work concurrently:
 * - Task: (a) Write to Queue -> (b) Write request bit
 *   The Task have to write request bit (b) after the data is prepared in the queue (a),
 *   otherwise the BG may fail to read from the queue when it sees the request bit set.
 *
 * - BG: (c) Read queue -> (d) Clear request bit
 *   Since the BG cannot know the number of requests queued, it have to repeatedly check the
 *   queue (c), until it find the data is empty, and then clear the request bit (d).
 *
 * The events are possible to happen in the order: (c) -> (a) -> (b) -> (d). This may cause a false
 * clear of the request bit. And there will be data prepared in the queue, but the request bit is
 * inactive.
 *
 * (e) move REQ bits to PEND bits, happen before (c) is introduced to solve this problem. In this
 * case (d) is changed to clear the PEND bit. Even if (e) -> (c) -> (a) -> (b) -> (d), only PEND
 * bit is cleared, while the REQ bit is still active.
