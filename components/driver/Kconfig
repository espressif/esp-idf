                ADC power can be controlled by the FSM instead of software. This allows the ADC to
                be shut off when it is not working leading to lower power consumption. However
                using the FSM control ADC power will increase the noise of ADC.

                If this is set, the ADC2 driver will disable the output of the DAC corresponding to the specified
                channel. This is the default value.

                For testing, disable this option so that we can measure the output of DAC by internal ADC.

                Normally only the ISR of SPI master is placed in the IRAM, so that it

                For other functions, there's some possibility that the flash cache

                the interval of SPI transactions.
                Enable this to put ``queue_trans``, ``get_trans_result`` and

                (such as when writing to SPI Flash).
                Note that if this option is enabled:
                - Users should also set the ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM in the driver
                configuration structure when installing the driver (see docs for
                specifics).
                - Alert logging (i.e., setting of the TWAI_ALERT_AND_LOG flag)

                When the bus-off condition is reached, the REC should be reset to 0 and frozen (via LOM) by the
                driver's ISR. However on the ESP32, there is an edge case where the REC will increase before the
                driver's ISR can respond in time (e.g., due to the rapid occurrence of bus errors), thus causing the
                REC to be non-zero after bus-off. A non-zero REC can prevent bus-off recovery as the bus-off recovery
                condition is that both TEC and REC become 0. Enabling this option will add a workaround in the driver
                to forcibly reset REC to zero on reaching bus-off.

                On the ESP32, when a transmit interrupt occurs, and interrupt register is read on the same APB clock
                cycle, the transmit interrupt could be lost. Enabling this option will add a workaround that checks the
                transmit buffer status bit to recover any lost transmit interrupt.

                On the ESP32, when receiving a data or remote frame, if a bus error occurs in the data or CRC field,
                the data of the next received frame could be invalid. Enabling this option will add a workaround that
                will reset the peripheral on detection of this errata condition. Note that if a frame is transmitted on
                the bus whilst the reset is ongoing, the message will not be receive by the peripheral sent on the bus
                during the reset, the message will be lost.

                On the ESP32, when the RX FIFO overruns and the RX message counter maxes out at 64 messages, the entire
                RX FIFO is no longer recoverable. Enabling this option will add a workaround that resets the peripheral
                on detection of this errata condition. Note that if a frame is being sent on the bus during the reset
                bus during the reset, the message will be lost.
