                If this is set, the ADC2 driver will disable the output of the DAC corresponding to the specified
                channel. This is the default value.

                For testing, disable this option so that we can measure the output of DAC by internal ADC.

                    to correct for non-linear behavior in 11db attenuation. Other attenuations
                    do not exhibit non-linear behavior hence will not be affected by this option.

                If enabled, the chip will constantly monitor the connection status of the USB Serial/JTAG port. As long
                as the USB Serial/JTAG is connected, a ESP_PM_NO_LIGHT_SLEEP power management lock will be acquired to
                prevent the system from entering light sleep.
                This option can be useful if serial monitoring is needed via USB Serial/JTAG while power management is
                enabled, as the USB Serial/JTAG cannot work under light sleep and after waking up from light sleep.
                Note. This option can only control the automatic Light-Sleep behavior. If esp_light_sleep_start() is
                called manually from the program, enabling this option will not prevent light sleep entry even if the
                USB Serial/JTAG is in use.
