    bool "Use the FSM to control ADC power"
    default n
    help
        ADC power can be controlled by the FSM instead of software. This allows the ADC to 
        be shut off when it is not working leading to lower power consumption. However 
        using the FSM control ADC power will increase the noise of ADC.

config ADC2_DISABLE_DAC
    bool "Disable DAC when ADC2 is used on GPIO 25 and 26"
    default y
    help
        If this is set, the ADC2 driver will disables the output of the DAC corresponding to the specified channel. This is the default value.

        For testing, disable this option so that we can measure the output of DAC by internal ADC.

    help
        Normally only the ISR of SPI master is placed in the IRAM, so that it
        can work without the flash when interrupt is triggered.
        For other functions, there's some possibility that the flash cache
        miss when running inside and out of SPI functions, which may increase
        the interval of SPI transactions.
        Enable this to put ``queue_trans``, ``get_trans_result`` and
        ``transmit`` functions into the IRAM to avoid possible cache miss.

        During unit test, this is enabled to measure the ideal case of api.

config SPI_MASTER_ISR_IN_IRAM
    bool "Place SPI master ISR function into IRAM"
    default y
    help
        Place the SPI master ISR in to IRAM to avoid possibly cache miss, or
        being disabled during flash writing access.
