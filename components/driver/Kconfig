                ADC power can be controlled by the FSM instead of software. This allows the ADC to
                be shut off when it is not working leading to lower power consumption. However
                using the FSM control ADC power will increase the noise of ADC.

            help
                If this is set, the ADC2 driver will disable the output of the DAC corresponding to the specified
                channel. This is the default value.

                For testing, disable this option so that we can measure the output of DAC by internal ADC.

                Normally only the ISR of SPI master is placed in the IRAM, so that it
                can work without the flash when interrupt is triggered.
                For other functions, there's some possibility that the flash cache
                miss when running inside and out of SPI functions, which may increase
                the interval of SPI transactions.
                Enable this to put ``queue_trans``, ``get_trans_result`` and
                ``transmit`` functions into the IRAM to avoid possible cache miss.

                During unit test, this is enabled to measure the ideal case of api.
