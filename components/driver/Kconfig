            help
                If this is set, the ADC2 driver will disable the output of the DAC corresponding to the specified
                channel. This is the default value.

                For testing, disable this option so that we can measure the output of DAC by internal ADC.

                Whether to suppress the deprecation warnings when using legacy adc driver (driver/adc.h).
                If you want to continue using the legacy driver, and don't want to see related deprecation warnings,

                    Some ESP32s have Two Point calibration values burned into eFuse BLOCK3.
                    This option will allow the ADC calibration component to characterize the
                    ADC-Voltage curve using Two Point values if they are available.

                    This option will allow the ADC calibration component to use Lookup Tables
                    to correct for non-linear behavior in 11db attenuation. Other attenuations
                    do not exhibit non-linear behavior hence will not be affected by this option.
