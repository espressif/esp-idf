    help
        Number of DMA receive buffers. Each buffer is 1600 bytes.
        Buffers are allocated statically.
        Larger number of buffers increases throughput.
        If enable flow ctrl, the num must be above 9 .

    help
        Number of DMA transmit buffers. Each buffer is 1600 bytes.
        Buffers are allocated statically.
        Larger number of buffers increases throughput.

    default n
    help
        If this options is selected, a copy of each received buffer will be created when
        passing it from the Ethernet MAC (L2) to the IP stack (L3). Otherwise, IP stack
        will receive pointers to the DMA buffers used by Ethernet MAC.
        
        When Ethernet MAC doesn't have any unused buffers left, it will drop incomming
        packets (flow control may help with this problem, to some extent).
        
        The buffers for the IP stack are allocated from the heap, so the total number of
        receive buffers is limited by the available heap size, if this option is selected.
        
        If unsure, choose n.

        Ethernet MAC task priority.
