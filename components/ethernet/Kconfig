        int "Number of DMA RX buffers"
        range 3 20

        help
            Number of DMA receive buffers. Each buffer is 1600 bytes.
            These buffers are allocated dynamically.
            More buffers will increase throughput.
            If flow ctrl is enabled, make sure this number is larger than 9.

    config DMA_TX_BUF_NUM
        int "Number of DMA TX buffers"
        range 3 20
        default 10
        help
            Number of DMA transmit buffers. Each buffer is 1600 bytes.
            These buffers are allocated dynamically.
            More buffers will increase throughput.

    config EMAC_L2_TO_L3_RX_BUF_MODE
        bool "Enable received buffers be copied to Layer3 from Layer2"
        default y
        help
            If this option is selected, a copy of each received buffer will be allocated from the heap
            before passing it to the IP Layer (L3).
            Which means, the total amount of received buffers is limited by the heap size.

            If this option is not selected, IP layer only uses the pointers to the DMA buffers owned by Ethernet MAC.
            When Ethernet MAC doesn't have any available buffers left, it will drop the incoming packets.

    config EMAC_CHECK_LINK_PERIOD_MS
        int "Period (ms) of checking Ethernet linkup status"
        range 1000 5000
        default 2000
        help
            The emac driver uses an internal timer to check the Ethernet linkup status.
            Here you should choose a valid interval time.

    config EMAC_TASK_PRIORITY
        int "EMAC_TASK_PRIORITY"

            Priority of Ethernet MAC task.

    config EMAC_TASK_STACK_SIZE
        int "Stack Size of EMAC Task"
        default 3072
        range 2000 8000
        help
            Stack Size of Ethernet MAC task.
