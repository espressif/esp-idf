config DMA_RX_BUF_NUM
    int "Number of DMA RX buffers"

    help
        Number of DMA receive buffers. Each buffer is 1600 bytes.
        Buffers are allocated statically.
        Larger number of buffers increases throughput.
        If enable flow ctrl, the num must be above 9 .

    help
        Number of DMA transmit buffers. Each buffer is 1600 bytes.
        Buffers are allocated statically.
        Larger number of buffers increases throughput.

config EMAC_L2_TO_L3_RX_BUF_MODE
    bool "Enable copy between Layer2 and Layer3"
    default n
    help
        If this options is selected, a copy of each received buffer will be created when
        passing it from the Ethernet MAC (L2) to the IP stack (L3). Otherwise, IP stack
        will receive pointers to the DMA buffers used by Ethernet MAC.

        When Ethernet MAC doesn't have any unused buffers left, it will drop incoming
        packets (flow control may help with this problem, to some extent).

        The buffers for the IP stack are allocated from the heap, so the total number of
        receive buffers is limited by the available heap size, if this option is selected.

        If unsure, choose n.

    help
        The emac driver uses an internal timer to check the ethernet linkup
        status. Here you should choose a valid the interval time.
