            The recovery bootloader feature is implemented in the ROM bootloader. It is required for safe OTA
            updates of the bootloader. The feature is activated when the eFuse field
            (ESP_EFUSE_RECOVERY_BOOTLOADER_FLASH_SECTOR) is set, which defines the flash address of the
            recovery bootloader. If activated and the primary bootloader fails to load, the ROM bootloader
            will attempt to load the recovery bootloader from the address specified in eFuse.

    config BOOTLOADER_RECOVERY_OFFSET
        hex "Recovery Bootloader Flash Offset"
        depends on BOOTLOADER_RECOVERY_ENABLE
        default 0x3F0000
        range 0x0 0xFFE000
        help
            Flash address where the recovery bootloader is stored.
            This value must be written to the eFuse field (ESP_EFUSE_RECOVERY_BOOTLOADER_FLASH_SECTOR)
            to activate the recovery bootloader in the ROM bootloader. The eFuse can be programmed
            using espefuse or in the user application with the API esp_efuse_set_recovery_bootloader_offset().
            Setting this value in the config allows parttool.py to verify that it does not overlap with existing
            partitions in the partition table.

            The address must be a multiple of the flash sector size (0x1000 bytes).
            The eFuse field stores the offset in sectors.
            If the feature is no longer needed or unused, you can burn the 0xFFF value to disable this feature in
            the ROM bootloader.

    config BOOTLOADER_ANTI_ROLLBACK_ENABLE
        bool "Enable bootloader rollback support"
        depends on BOOTLOADER_RECOVERY_ENABLE
        default n
        help
            This option prevents rollback to previous bootloader image with lower security version.

    config BOOTLOADER_SECURE_VERSION
        int "Secure version of bootloader"
        depends on BOOTLOADER_ANTI_ROLLBACK_ENABLE
        default 0
        range 0 4
        help
            The secure version is the sequence number stored in the header of each bootloader.

            The ROM Bootloader which runs the 2nd stage bootloader (PRIMARY or RECOVERY) checks that
            the security version is greater or equal that recorded in the eFuse field.
            Bootloaders that have a secure version in the image < secure version in efuse will not boot.

            The security version is worth increasing if in previous versions there is
            a significant vulnerability and their use is not acceptable.
