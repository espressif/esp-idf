            Choose what sort of timestamp is displayed in the log output:

            - "None" - The log will only contain the actual log messages themselves
              without any time-related information. Avoiding timestamps can help conserve
              processing power and memory. It might useful when you
              perform log analysis or debugging, sometimes it's more straightforward
              to work with logs that lack timestamps, especially if the time of occurrence
              is not critical for understanding the issues.

            - "Milliseconds since boot" is calculated from the RTOS tick count multiplied
              by the tick period. This time will reset after a software reboot.
