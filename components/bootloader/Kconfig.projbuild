                This allows the secure bootloader to be re-flashed by anyone with access to the secure boot signing
                key.

                This option is less secure than one-time flash, because a leak of the digest key from one device
                allows reflashing of any device that uses it.

                space. This prevents an attacker from appending unverified data after the app image in the flash,
                causing it to be mapped into the address space.
