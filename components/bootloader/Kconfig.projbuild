            Some applications need to boot very quickly from power on. By default, the entire app binary

            Enabling this option will skip validation of the app when the SoC boots from power on.
            Note that in this case it's not possible for the bootloader to detect if an app image is
            corrupted in the flash, therefore it's not possible to safely fall back to a different app
            partition. Flash corruption of this kind is unlikely but can happen if there is a serious
            firmware bug or physical damage.

            Following other reset types, the bootloader will still validate the app image. This increases
            the chances that flash corruption resulting in a crash can be detected following soft reset, and
            the bootloader will fall back to a valid app image. To increase the chances of successfully recovering

            BOOTLOADER_WDT_DISABLE_IN_USER_CODE - then manually disable the RTC Watchdog once the app is running.
