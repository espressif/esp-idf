        bool "Place GPTimer ISR handler into IRAM"
        default y
        help
            Place GPTimer ISR handler into IRAM for better performance and fewer cache misses.

    config GPTIMER_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM
        bool "Place GPTimer control functions into IRAM"
        default n
        help
            Place GPTimer control functions (like start/stop) into IRAM,
            so that these functions can be IRAM-safe and able to be called in the other IRAM interrupt context.
            Enabling this option can improve driver performance as well.

    config GPTIMER_ISR_IRAM_SAFE
        bool "GPTimer ISR IRAM-Safe"
        select GPTIMER_ISR_HANDLER_IN_IRAM
        default n
        help
            Ensure the GPTimer interrupt is IRAM-Safe by allowing the interrupt handler to be
            executable when the cache is disabled (e.g. SPI Flash write).

    config GPTIMER_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATE_WARN
        bool "Suppress legacy driver deprecated warning"
        default n
        help
            Wether to suppress the deprecation warnings when using legacy timer group driver (driver/timer.h).
            If you want to continue using the legacy driver, and don't want to see related deprecation warnings,
            you can enable this option.

    config GPTIMER_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG
        bool "Enable debug log"
        default n
        help
            Wether to enable the debug log message for GPTimer driver.
            Note that, this option only controls the GPTimer driver log, won't affect other drivers.
