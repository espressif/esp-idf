            Allocation strategy for mbedTLS, essentially provides ability to
            allocate all required dynamic allocations from,

            - Internal DRAM memory only
            - External SPIRAM memory only
            - Either internal or external memory based on default malloc()
              behavior in ESP-IDF
            - Custom allocation mode, by overwriting calloc()/free() using
              mbedtls_platform_set_calloc_free() function
            - Internal IRAM memory wherever applicable else internal DRAM

            Recommended mode here is always internal (*), since that is most preferred
            from security perspective. But if application requirement does not
            allow sufficient free internal memory then alternate mode can be
            selected.

            (*) In case of ESP32-S2, hardware allows encryption of external
            SPIRAM contents provided hardware flash encryption feature is enabled.
            In that case, using external SPIRAM allocation strategy is also safe choice
            from security perspective.
