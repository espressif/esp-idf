/** @brief Low-level support functions for the hardware SHA engine
 *
 * @note If you're looking for a SHA API to use, try mbedtls component
 * mbedtls/shaXX.h. That API supports hardware acceleration.
 *
 * The API in this header provides some building blocks for implementing a
 * full SHA API such as the one in mbedtls, and also a basic SHA function esp_sha().
 *
 * Some technical details about the hardware SHA engine:
 *
 * - SHA accelerator engine calculates one digest at a time, per SHA
 *   algorithm type. It initialises and maintains the digest state
 *   internally. It is possible to read out an in-progress SHA digest
 *   state, but it is not possible to restore a SHA digest state
 *   into the engine.
 *
 * - The memory block SHA_TEXT_BASE is shared between all SHA digest
 *   engines, so all engines must be idle before this memory block is
 *   modified.
 *
