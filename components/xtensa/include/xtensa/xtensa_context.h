  INTERRUPT/EXCEPTION STACK FRAME FOR A THREAD OR NESTED INTERRUPT

  A stack frame of this structure is allocated for any interrupt or exception.
  It goes on the current stack. If the RTOS has a system stack for handling
  interrupts, every thread stack must allow space for just one interrupt stack
  frame, then nested interrupt stack frames go on the system stack.

  The frame includes basic registers (explicit) and "extra" registers introduced
  by user TIE or the use of the MAC16 option in the user's Xtensa config.
  The frame size is minimized by omitting regs not applicable to user's config.

  For Windowed ABI, this stack frame includes the interruptee's base save area,
  another base save area to manage gcc nested functions, and a little temporary
  space to help manage the spilling of the register windows.

  SOLICITED STACK FRAME FOR A THREAD

  A stack frame of this structure is allocated whenever a thread enters the
  RTOS kernel intentionally (and synchronously) to submit to thread scheduling.
  It goes on the current thread's stack.

  The solicited frame only includes registers that are required to be preserved
  by the callee according to the compiler's ABI conventions, some space to save
  the return address for returning to the caller, and the caller's PS register.

  Note: Although the xtensa ABI considers the threadptr as "global" across
  functions (meanig it is neither caller or callee saved), it is treated as a
  callee-saved register in a solicited stack frame. This omits the need for the
  OS to include extra logic to save "global" registers on each context switch.
  Only the threadptr register is treated as callee-saved, as all other NCP
  (non-coprocessor extra) registers are caller-saved. See "tie.h" for more
  details.

  For Windowed ABI, this stack frame includes the caller's base save area.

  Note on XT_SOL_EXIT field:
      It is necessary to distinguish a solicited from an interrupt stack frame.
      This field corresponds to XT_STK_EXIT in the interrupt stack frame and is
      always at the same offset (0). It can be written with a code (usually 0)
      to distinguish a solicted frame from an interrupt frame. An RTOS port may
      opt to ignore this field if it has another way of distinguishing frames.

  CO-PROCESSOR STATE SAVE AREA FOR A THREAD

  The RTOS must provide an area per thread to save the state of co-processors
  when that thread does not have control. Co-processors are context-switched
  lazily (on demand) only when a new thread uses a co-processor instruction,
  otherwise a thread retains ownership of the co-processor even when it loses
  control of the processor. An Xtensa co-processor exception is triggered when
  any co-processor instruction is executed by a thread that is not the owner,
  and the context switch of that co-processor is then peformed by the handler.
  Ownership represents which thread's state is currently in the co-processor.

  Co-processors may not be used by interrupt or exception handlers. If an
  co-processor instruction is executed by an interrupt or exception handler,
  the co-processor exception handler will trigger a kernel panic and freeze.
  This restriction is introduced to reduce the overhead of saving and restoring
  co-processor state (which can be quite large) and in particular remove that
  overhead from interrupt handlers.

  The co-processor state save area may be in any convenient per-thread location
  such as in the thread control block or above the thread stack area. It need
  not be in the interrupt stack frame since interrupts don't use co-processors.

  Along with the save area for each co-processor, two bitmasks with flags per
  co-processor (laid out as in the CPENABLE reg) help manage context-switching
  co-processors as efficiently as possible:

  XT_CPENABLE
    The contents of a non-running thread's CPENABLE register.
    It represents the co-processors owned (and whose state is still needed)
    by the thread. When a thread is preempted, its CPENABLE is saved here.
    When a thread solicits a context-swtich, its CPENABLE is cleared - the
    compiler has saved the (caller-saved) co-proc state if it needs to.
    When a non-running thread loses ownership of a CP, its bit is cleared.
    When a thread runs, it's XT_CPENABLE is loaded into the CPENABLE reg.
    Avoids co-processor exceptions when no change of ownership is needed.

  XT_CPSTORED
    A bitmask with the same layout as CPENABLE, a bit per co-processor.
    Indicates whether the state of each co-processor is saved in the state
    save area. When a thread enters the kernel, only the state of co-procs
    still enabled in CPENABLE is saved. When the co-processor exception
    handler assigns ownership of a co-processor to a thread, it restores
    the saved state only if this bit is set, and clears this bit.

  XT_CP_CS_ST
    A bitmask with the same layout as CPENABLE, a bit per co-processor.
    Indicates whether callee-saved state is saved in the state save area.
    Callee-saved state is saved by itself on a solicited context switch,
    and restored when needed by the coprocessor exception handler.
    Unsolicited switches will cause the entire coprocessor to be saved
    when necessary.

  XT_CP_ASA
    Pointer to the aligned save area.  Allows it to be aligned more than
    the overall save area (which might only be stack-aligned or TCB-aligned).
    Especially relevant for Xtensa cores configured with a very large data
    path that requires alignment greater than 16 bytes (ABI stack alignment).

    ENTRY0,    RET0    are for frameless functions (no locals, no calls).

  where size = size of stack frame in bytes (must be >0 and aligned to 16).
  For framed functions the frame is created and the return address saved at
  base of frame (Call0 ABI) or as determined by hardware (Windowed ABI).
  For frameless functions, there is no frame and return address remains in a0.
  Note: Because CPP macros expand to a single line, macros requiring multi-line
