        RTOS-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR XTENSA RTOS ASSEMBLER SOURCES
                            (FreeRTOS Port)

This header is the primary glue between generic Xtensa RTOS support
sources and a specific RTOS port for Xtensa.  It contains definitions
and macros for use primarily by Xtensa assembly coded source files.

Macros in this header map callouts from generic Xtensa files to specific
RTOS functions. It may also be included in C source files.

Xtensa RTOS ports support all RTOS-compatible configurations of the Xtensa 
architecture, using the Xtensa hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to deal 
with configuration specifics.

Should be included by all Xtensa generic and RTOS port-specific sources.

/*******************************************************************************

HOOKS TO DYNAMICALLY INSTALL INTERRUPT AND EXCEPTION HANDLERS PER LEVEL.

This Xtensa RTOS port provides hooks for dynamically installing exception
and interrupt handlers to facilitate automated testing where each test
case can install its own handler for user exceptions and each interrupt
priority (level). This consists of an array of function pointers indexed
by interrupt priority, with index 0 being the user exception handler hook.
Each entry in the array is initially 0, and may be replaced by a function 
pointer of type XT_INTEXC_HOOK. A handler may be uninstalled by installing 0.

The handler for low and medium priority obeys ABI conventions so may be coded
in C. For the exception handler, the cause is the contents of the EXCCAUSE
reg, and the result is -1 if handled, else the cause (still needs handling).
For interrupt handlers, the cause is a mask of pending enabled interrupts at
that level, and the result is the same mask with the bits for the handled
interrupts cleared (those not cleared still need handling). This allows a test
case to either pre-handle or override the default handling for the exception
or interrupt level (see xtensa_vectors.S).

High priority handlers (including NMI) must be coded in assembly, are always
called by 'call0' regardless of ABI, must preserve all registers except a0,
and must not use or modify the interrupted stack. The hook argument 'cause'
is not passed and the result is ignored, so as not to burden the caller with
saving and restoring a2 (it assumes only one interrupt per level - see the
discussion in high priority interrupts in xtensa_vectors.S). The handler
therefore should be coded to prototype 'void h(void)' even though it plugs
into an array of handlers of prototype 'unsigned h(unsigned)'.

To enable interrupt/exception hooks, compile the RTOS with '-DXT_INTEXC_HOOKS'.
