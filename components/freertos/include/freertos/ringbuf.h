/**
 * @brief The various types of buffer
 *
 * A ringbuffer instantiated by these functions essentially acts like a
 * FreeRTOS queue, with the difference that it's strictly FIFO and with
 * the main advantage that you can put in randomly-sized items. The capacity,
 * accordingly, isn't measured in the amount of items, but the amount of
 * memory that is used for storing the items. Dependent on the size of
 * the items, more or less of them will fit in the ring buffer.
 *
 * This ringbuffer tries to be efficient with memory: when inserting an item,
 * the item data will be copied to the ringbuffer memory. When retrieving
 * an item, however, a reference to ringbuffer memory will be returned.
 * The returned memory is guaranteed to be 32-bit aligned and contiguous.
 * The application can use this memory, but as long as it does, ringbuffer
 * writes that would write to this bit of memory will block.
 *
 * The requirement for items to be contiguous is slightly problematic when
 * the only way to place the next item would involve a wraparound from the end
 * to the beginning of the ringbuffer. This can be solved (or not) in a few ways,
 * see descriptions of possible ringbuf_type_t types below.
 *
 * The maximum size of an item will be affected by ringbuffer type.
 * When split items are allowed, it is acceptable to push items of
 * (buffer_size)-16 bytes into the buffer.
 * When it's not allowed, the maximum size is (buffer_size/2)-8 bytes.
 * The bytebuf can fill the entire buffer with data, it has no overhead.
 */

	 * of the buffer, and writes can be broken up in any way possible.
