Header definitions for a FreeRTOS ringbuffer object

A ringbuffer instantiated by these functions essentially acts like a FreeRTOS queue, with the
difference that it's strictly FIFO and with the main advantage that you can put in randomly-sized
items. The capacity, accordingly, isn't measured in the amount of items, but the amount of memory
that is used for storing the items. Dependent on the size of the items, more or less of them will 
fit in the ring buffer.

This ringbuffer tries to be efficient with memory: when inserting an item, the item data will
be copied to the ringbuffer memory. When retrieving an item, however, a reference to ringbuffer
memory will be returned. The returned memory is guaranteed to be 32-bit aligned and contiguous.
The application can use this memory, but as long as it does, ringbuffer writes that would write
to this bit of memory will block.

The requirement for items to be contiguous is slightly problematic when the only way to place
the next item would involve a wraparound from the end to the beginning of the ringbuffer. This can
be solved (or not) in a few ways:
- type = RINGBUF_TYPE_ALLOWSPLIT: The insertion code will split the item in two items; one which fits
in the space left at the end of the ringbuffer, one that contains the remaining data which is placed
in the beginning. Two xRingbufferReceive calls will be needed to retrieve the data.
- type = RINGBUF_TYPE_NOSPLIT: The insertion code will leave the room at the end of the ringbuffer
unused and instead will put the entire item at the start of the ringbuffer, as soon as there is 
enough free space.
- type = RINGBUF_TYPE_BYTEBUF: This is your conventional byte-based ringbuffer. It does have no
overhead, but it has no item contiguousness either: a read will just give you the entire written
buffer space, or the space up to the end of the buffer, and writes can be broken up in any way 
possible. Note that this type cannot do a 2nd read before returning the memory of the 1st.

The maximum size of an item will be affected by this decision. When split items are allowed, it's
acceptable to push items of (buffer_size)-16 bytes into the buffer. When it's not allowed, the
maximum size is (buffer_size/2)-8 bytes. The bytebuf can fill the entire buffer with data, it has
no overhead.
