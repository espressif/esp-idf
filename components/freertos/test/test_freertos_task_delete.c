/*
 * Test backported deletion behavior by creating tasks of various affinities and
 * check if the task memory is freed immediately under the correct conditions.
 *
 * The behavior of vTaskDelete() has been backported form FreeRTOS v9.0.0. This
 * results in the immediate freeing of task memory and the immediate execution
 * of deletion callbacks under the following conditions...
 * - When deleting a task that is not currently running on either core
 * - When deleting a task that is pinned to the same core (with respect to
 *   the core that calls vTaskDelete()
 *
 * If the two conditions are not met, freeing of task memory and execution of
 * deletion callbacks will still be carried out by the Idle Task.
