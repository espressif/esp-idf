    bool "Set a debug watchpoint as a stack overflow check"
    default n
    help
        FreeRTOS can check if a stack has overflown its bounds by checking either the value of
        the stack pointer or by checking the integrity of canary bytes. (See FREERTOS_CHECK_STACKOVERFLOW
        for more information.) These checks only happen on a context switch, and the situation that caused
        the stack overflow may already be long gone by then. This option will use the debug memory
        watchpoint 1 (the second one) to allow breaking into the debugger (or panic'ing) as soon as any
        of the last 32 bytes on the stack of a task are overwritten. The side effect is that using gdb, you
        effectively only have one watchpoint; the 2nd one is overwritten as soon as a task switch happens.

        This check only triggers if the stack overflow writes within 4 bytes of the end of the stack, rather than
        overshooting further, so it is worth combining this approach with one of the other stack overflow check methods.

        When this watchpoint is hit, gdb will stop with a SIGTRAP message. When no JTAG OCD is attached, esp-idf
        will panic on an unhandled debug exception.

config FREERTOS_INTERRUPT_BACKTRACE

    help
        If this option is enabled, interrupt stack frame will be modified to
        point to the code of the interrupted task as its return address.
        This helps the debugger (or the panic handler) show a backtrace from
        the interrupt to the task which was interrupted. This also works for
        nested interrupts: higer level interrupt stack can be traced back to the
        lower level interrupt.

config SUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION
    bool "Enable FreeRTOS static allocation API"

        FreeRTOS gives the application writer the ability to instead provide the memory
        themselves, allowing the following objects to optionally be created without any
        memory being allocated dynamically:

            - Tasks
            - Software Timers
            - Queues
            - Event Groups
            - Binary Semaphores
            - Counting Semaphores
            - Recursive Semaphores
            - Mutexes

        Whether it is preferable to use static or dynamic memory allocation is dependent on
        the application, and the preference of the application writer. Both methods have pros
        and cons, and both methods can be used within the same RTOS application.

        Creating RTOS objects using statically allocated RAM has the benefit of providing the
        application writer with more control: RTOS objects can be placed at specific memory locations.
        The maximum RAM footprint can be determined at link time, rather than run time.
        The application writer does not need to concern themselves with graceful handling of memory allocation failures.
        It allows the RTOS to be used in applications that simply don't allow any dynamic memory allocation
        (although FreeRTOS includes allocation schemes that can overcome most objections).

        CPU Clock will be used as the clock source for the generation of run

        ESP32_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ and Dynamic Frequency Scaling (DFS).
        Therefore the CPU Clock frequency can fluctuate between 80 to 240MHz. 
        Run time stats generated using the CPU Clock represents the number of 
        CPU cycles each task is allocated and DOES NOT reflect the amount of 
        time each task runs for (as CPU clock frequency can change). If the CPU 
        clock consistently runs at the maximum frequency of 240MHz, it will 
        overflow in approximately 17 seconds.
