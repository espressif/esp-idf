            FreeRTOS can check if a stack has overflown its bounds by checking either the value of
            the stack pointer or by checking the integrity of canary bytes. (See FREERTOS_CHECK_STACKOVERFLOW
            for more information.) These checks only happen on a context switch, and the situation that caused
            the stack overflow may already be long gone by then. This option will use the last debug memory
            watchpoint to allow breaking into the debugger (or panic'ing) as soon as any
            of the last 32 bytes on the stack of a task are overwritten. The side effect is that using gdb, you
            effectively have one hardware watchpoint less because the last one is overwritten as soon as a task
            switch happens.

            Another consequence is that due to alignment requirements of the watchpoint, the usable stack size
            decreases by up to 60 bytes. This is because the watchpoint region has to be aligned to its size and the
            size for the stack watchpoint in IDF is 32 bytes.

            This check only triggers if the stack overflow writes within 32 bytes near the end of the stack, rather
            than overshooting further, so it is worth combining this approach with one of the other stack overflow
            check methods.

            When this watchpoint is hit, gdb will stop with a SIGTRAP message. When no JTAG OCD is attached, esp-idf
            will panic on an unhandled debug exception.

            If enabled, context of port*_CRITICAL calls (ISR or Non-ISR)
            would be checked to be in compliance with Vanilla FreeRTOS.
            e.g Calling port*_CRITICAL from ISR context would cause assert failure

            When enabled the selected Non-ISR FreeRTOS functions will be placed into Flash memory instead of IRAM.
            This saves up to 8KB of IRAM depending on which functions are used.

            When enabled, the functions related to snapshots, such as vTaskGetSnapshot or uxTaskGetSnapshotAll,
            will be placed in flash. Note that if enabled, these functions cannot be called when cache is disabled.
