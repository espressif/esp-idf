                Amazon has released an SMP version of the FreeRTOS Kernel which can be found via the following link:
                https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/tree/smp

                IDF has added an experimental port of this SMP kernel located in
                components/freertos/FreeRTOS-Kernel-SMP. Enabling this option will cause IDF to use the Amazon SMP
                kernel. Note that THIS FEATURE IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT, users use this at their own risk.

                Leaving this option disabled will mean the IDF FreeRTOS kernel is used instead, which is located in:
                components/freertos/FreeRTOS-Kernel. Both kernel versions are SMP capable, but differ in
                their implementation and features.

                information.) These checks only happen on a context switch, and the situation that caused the stack
                overflow may already be long gone by then. This option will use the last debug memory watchpoint to
                allow breaking into the debugger (or panic'ing) as soon as any of the last 32 bytes on the stack of a
                task are overwritten. The side effect is that using gdb, you effectively have one hardware watchpoint
                less because the last one is overwritten as soon as a task switch happens.

                Another consequence is that due to alignment requirements of the watchpoint, the usable stack size
                decreases by up to 60 bytes. This is because the watchpoint region has to be aligned to its size and
                the size for the stack watchpoint in IDF is 32 bytes.

                This check only triggers if the stack overflow writes within 32 bytes near the end of the stack, rather
                than overshooting further, so it is worth combining this approach with one of the other stack overflow
                check methods.

                When this watchpoint is hit, gdb will stop with a SIGTRAP message. When no JTAG OCD is attached,
                esp-idf will panic on an unhandled debug exception.
