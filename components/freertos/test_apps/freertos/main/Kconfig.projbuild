            When enabled, FreeRTOS kernel, port, and ESP additions source files will be compiled with
            code coverage instrumentation flags (--coverage) to enable GCOV code coverage testing.

            Note: This option will increase binary size and may impact performance. It should only be
            enabled when running coverage tests.
