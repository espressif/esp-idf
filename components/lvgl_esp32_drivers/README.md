## Supported indev controllers

- XPT2046
- FT3236, FT6X36
- FT6206 controllers should work as well (not tested)
- STMPE610
- FT81x (Single, Dual, and Quad SPI)

If your display or input device (touch) controller is not supported consider contributing to this repo by
adding support to it! [Contribute controller support](CONTRIBUTE_CONTROLLER_SUPPORT.md)

## Support for predefined development kits

You can also use the predefined kits, which selects the correct display controllers on the kit,
and sets the gpio numbers for the interface.

## Thread-safe I2C with I2C Manager

LVGL can use I2C to read from a touch sensor or write to a display, possibly
many times a second. Meanwhile, other tasks may also want to read from i2c
devices on the same bus. I2C using the ESP-IDF is not thread-safe.

I2C Manager (`i2c_manager`) is a component that will let code in multiple threads
talk to devices on the I2C ports without getting in each other's way. These drivers
use a built-in copy of I2C Manager to talk to the I2C port, but you can also use 
the I2C Manager component itself and have others play nice with LVGL and vice-versa.
[Click here](i2c_manager/README.md) for details.


## Backlight control

Control of LCD's backlight is provided by separate module that is independent from the display driver.
Configuration of the backlight controller can be found in menuconfig `LVGL ESP Drivers -> LVGL TFT Display controller`.

There are three modes of operation:
1. Off - No backlight control
2. Switch - Allows ON/OFF control
3. PWM - Allows brightness control (by Pulse-Width-Modulated signal)
