 * in event_loop_args argument during loop creation. This function includes an argument to limit the amount of time
 * it runs, returning control to the caller when that time expires (or some time afterwards). There is no guarantee
 * that a call to this function will exit at exactly the time of expiry. There is also no guarantee that events have
 * been dispatched during the call, as the function might have spent all the allotted time waiting on the event queue.
 * Once an event has been dequeued, however, it is guaranteed to be dispatched. This guarantee contributes to not being
 * able to exit exactly at time of expiry as (1) blocking on internal mutexes is necessary for dispatching the dequeued
 * event, and (2) during  dispatch of the dequeued event there is no way to control the time occupied by handler code
 * execution. The guaranteed time of exit is therefore the allotted time + amount of time required to dispatch
 * the last dequeued event.
 *
 * In cases where waiting on the queue times out, ESP_OK is returned and not ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT, since it is
 * normal behavior.
 *
 * @param[in] event_loop event loop to dispatch posted events from, must not be NULL
 * @param[in] ticks_to_run number of ticks to run the loop
 *
 * @note encountering an unknown event that has been posted to the loop will only generate a warning, not an error.
