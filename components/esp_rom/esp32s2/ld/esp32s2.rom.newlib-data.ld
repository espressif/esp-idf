/**
 * These are the .bss/.data symbols used by newlib functions present in ESP32-S2 ROM.
 * See also esp32s2.rom.newlib-funcs.ld for the list of general newlib functions.
 *
 * Unlike other ROM functions and data which are exported using PROVIDE, which declare weak symbols,
 * newlib related functions are exported using assignment, which declare strong symbols.
 * This is done so that ROM functions are always used instead of the ones provided by libc.a.
