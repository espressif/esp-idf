    config MDNS_MAX_INTERFACES
        int "Max number of interfaces"
        range 1 9
        default 3
        help
            Number of network interfaces to be served by the mDNS library.
            Lowering this number helps to reduce some static RAM usage.

    config MDNS_MAX_SERVICES
        int "Max number of services"
        range 1 64
        default 10
        help
            Services take up a certain amount of memory, and allowing fewer
            services to be open at the same time conserves memory. Specify
            the maximum amount of services here. The valid value is from 1
            to 64.

    config MDNS_TASK_PRIORITY
        int "mDNS task priority"
        range 1 255
        default 1
        help
            Allows setting mDNS task priority. Please do not set the task priority
            higher than priorities of system tasks. Compile time warning/error
            would be emitted if the chosen task priority were too high.

    config MDNS_TASK_STACK_SIZE
        int "mDNS task stack size"
        default 4096
        help
            Allows setting mDNS task stacksize.

    choice MDNS_TASK_AFFINITY
        prompt "mDNS task affinity"
        default MDNS_TASK_AFFINITY_CPU0
        help
            Allows setting mDNS tasks affinity, i.e. whether the task is pinned to
            CPU0, pinned to CPU1, or allowed to run on any CPU.

        int "mDNS adding service timeout (ms)"
        range 10 30000

        help
            Configures timeout for adding a new mDNS service. Adding a service
            fails if could not be completed within this time.

    config MDNS_STRICT_MODE
        bool "mDNS strict mode"
        default "n"
        help
            Configures strict mode. Set this to 1 for the mDNS library to strictly follow the RFC6762:
            Currently the only strict feature: Do not repeat original questions in response packets
            (defined in RFC6762 sec. 6).
            Default configuration is 0, i.e. non-strict mode, since some implementations,
            such as lwIP mDNS resolver (used by standard POSIX API like getaddrinfo, gethostbyname)
            could not correctly resolve advertised names.

    config MDNS_TIMER_PERIOD_MS
        int "mDNS timer period (ms)"
        range 10 10000
        default 100
        help
            Configures period of mDNS timer, which periodically transmits packets
            and schedules mDNS searches.

    config MDNS_NETWORKING_SOCKET
        bool "Use BSD sockets for mDNS networking"
        default n
        help
            Enables optional mDNS networking implementation using BSD sockets
            in UDP multicast mode.
            This option creates a new thread to serve receiving packets (TODO).
            This option uses additional N sockets, where N is number of interfaces.

    config MDNS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCE
        bool "Multiple instances under the same service type"
        default y
        help
            Enables adding multiple service instances under the same service type.
