        help
            Services take up a certain amount of memory, and allowing fewer
            services to be open at the same time conserves memory. Specify
            the maximum amount of services here. The valid value is from 1
            to 64.

            Allows setting mDNS task priority. Please do not set the task priority
            higher than priorities of system tasks. Compile time warning/error
            would be emitted if the chosen task priority were too high.

            Allows setting mDNS tasks affinity, i.e. whether the task is pinned to
            CPU0, pinned to CPU1, or allowed to run on any CPU.

            Configures timeout for adding a new mDNS service. Adding a service
            fails if could not be completed within this time.

            Configures period of mDNS timer, which periodically transmits packets
            and schedules mDNS searches.
