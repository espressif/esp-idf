 * This module defines the interface for the application. It contains
 * the basic functions and types required to use the Modbus protocol stack.
 * A typical application will want to call eMBInit() first. If the device
 * is ready to answer network requests it must then call eMBEnable() to activate
 * the protocol stack. In the main loop the function eMBPoll() must be called
 * periodically. The time interval between pooling depends on the configured
 * Modbus timeout. If an RTOS is available a separate task should be created
 * and the task should always call the function eMBPoll().
 *
 * \code
 * // Initialize protocol stack in RTU mode for a slave with address 10 = 0x0A
 * eMBInit( MB_RTU, 0x0A, 38400, MB_PAR_EVEN );
