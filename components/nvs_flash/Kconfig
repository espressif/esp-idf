    config NVS_ENCRYPTION

        help
            This option enables encryption for NVS. When enabled, AES-XTS is used to encrypt
            the complete NVS data, except the page headers. It requires XTS encryption keys
            to be stored in an encrypted partition. This means enabling flash encryption is
            a pre-requisite for this feature.

    config NVS_COMPATIBLE_PRE_V4_3_ENCRYPTION_FLAG
        bool "NVS partition encrypted flag compatible with ESP-IDF before v4.3"
        depends on SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED
        help
            Enabling this will ignore "encrypted" flag for NVS partitions. NVS encryption
            scheme is different than hardware flash encryption and hence it is not recommended
            to have "encrypted" flag for NVS partitions. This was not being checked in pre v4.3
            IDF. Hence, if you have any devices where this flag is kept enabled in partition
            table then enabling this config will allow to have same behavior as pre v4.3 IDF.

    config NVS_ASSERT_ERROR_CHECK
        bool "Use assertions for error checking"
        default n
        help
            This option switches error checking type between assertions (y) or return codes (n).
