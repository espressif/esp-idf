            This option enables encryption for NVS. When enabled, AES-XTS is used to encrypt
            the complete NVS data, except the page headers. It requires XTS encryption keys
            to be stored in an encrypted partition. This means enabling flash encryption is
            a pre-requisite for this feature.
