        help
            This option enables gathering host test statistics and SPI flash wear levelling simulation.

    config ESP_PARTITION_ERASE_CHECK
        bool "Check if flash is erased before writing"
        depends on IDF_TARGET_LINUX
        default y
        help
            This option controls whether the partition implementation checks
            if the flash is erased before writing to it.
            This is necessary for SPIFFS, which expects to be able to write without erasing first.
