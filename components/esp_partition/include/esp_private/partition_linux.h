/**
 * @brief Creates memory emulation of SPI FLASH device (Linux host)
 *
 * The function creates a memory buffer to emulate SPI FLASH device and provides a pointer to its beginning, in order
 * to allow relevant Partition APIs run in host-emulated environment without any code change.
 *
 * The emulation buffer is actually a disk file mapped to the host memory, current version implements the following:
 * 1. create temporary file /tmp/idf-partition-XXXXXX (fixed size 4MB)
 * 2. mmap() whole file to the memory and set its contents to all 1s (SPI NOR flash default)
 * 3. upload build/partition_table/partition-table.bin (hard-wired path for now) to ESP_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET
 *    (from the beginning of the memory buffer, ie to the same offset as in real SPI FLASH)
 * 4. [optional: iterate through the partitions uploaded and print esp_partition_info_t details for each]
 * 5. set part_desc_addr_start[out] parameter to the memory buffer starting address
 *
 * The pointer returned in part_desc_addr_start is then used as it was regular SPI FLASH address.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * 1. the temporary file generated is not deleted automatically - the cleanup happens during the next host system reset
 * 2. the mmapped() section remains active until esp_partition_file_unmmap() is called
 * 3. mmap() is called with MAP_SHARED so the emulated SPI FLASH can be shared among processes
