            If the number of universal MAC addresses is four, all four interfaces (WiFi station, WiFi softap,
            Bluetooth and Ethernet) receive a universally administered MAC address. These are generated
            sequentially by adding 0, 1, 2 and 3 (respectively) to the final octet of the base MAC address.
            If the number of universal MAC addresses is two, only two interfaces (WiFi station and Bluetooth)

            and 1 (respectively) to the base MAC address. The remaining two interfaces (WiFi softap and Ethernet)

              resolution. This is the default, and the recommended option.
            - If only high-resolution timer is used, gettimeofday will
              provide time at microsecond resolution.
              Time will not be preserved when going into deep sleep mode.
            - If only RTC timer is used, timekeeping will continue in
              deep sleep, but time will be measured at 6.(6) microsecond
              resolution. Also the gettimeofday function itself may take
              longer to run.
            - If no timers are used, gettimeofday and time functions
              return -1 and set errno to ENOSYS.
            - When RTC is used for timekeeping, two RTC_STORE registers are
              used to keep time in deep sleep mode.

            When the startup code initializes RTC_SLOW_CLK, it can perform
            calibration by comparing the RTC_SLOW_CLK frequency with main XTAL
            frequency. This option sets the number of RTC_SLOW_CLK cycles measured
            by the calibration routine. Higher numbers increase calibration
            precision, which may be important for applications which spend a lot of
            time in deep sleep. Lower numbers reduce startup time.

            When this option is set to 0, clock calibration will not be performed at
            startup, and approximate clock frequencies will be assumed:

            - 150000 Hz if internal RC oscillator is used as clock source. For this use value 1024.
            - 32768 Hz if the 32k crystal oscillator is used. For this use value 3000 or more.
              In case more value will help improve the definition of the launch of the crystal.
              If the crystal could not start, it will be switched to internal RC.

            This option has run-time overhead (increased interrupt latency,
            longer time to enter idle state), and it also reduces accuracy of
            RTOS ticks and timers used for timekeeping.
            Enable this option if application uses power management APIs.

            When APB clock frequency changes, high-resolution timer (esp_timer)
            scale and base value need to be adjusted. Each adjustment may cause
            small error, and over time such small errors may cause time drift.
            If this option is enabled, RTC timer will be used as a reference to
            compensate for the drift.
            It is recommended that this option is only used if 32k XTAL is selected
            as RTC clock source.

            each of the power management locks has been held, and esp_pm_dump_locks
            function will print this information.
            This feature can be used to analyze which locks are preventing the chip
            from going into a lower power state, and see what time the chip spends
            in each power saving mode. This feature does incur some run-time

            frequency switching, entry/exit from idle state. Refer to pm_trace.c

            This feature is intended to be used when analyzing/debugging behavior
            of power management implementation, and should be kept disabled in
            applications.
