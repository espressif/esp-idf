            Enable builtin GDBStub.
            This allows to debug the target device using serial port:
            - Run 'idf.py monitor'.
            - Wait for the device to initialize.
            - Press Ctrl+C to interrupt the execution and enter GDB attached to your device for debugging.
            NOTE: all UART input will be handled by GDBStub.

    config ESP_GDBSTUB_SUPPORT_TASKS
        bool "Enable listing FreeRTOS tasks through GDB Stub"
        depends on ESP_GDBSTUB_ENABLED
        default y
        help
            If enabled, GDBStub can supply the list of FreeRTOS tasks to GDB.
            Thread list can be queried from GDB using 'info threads' command.
            Note that if GDB task lists were corrupted, this feature may not work.
            If GDBStub fails, try disabling this feature.

    config ESP_GDBSTUB_MAX_TASKS
        int "Maximum number of tasks supported by GDB Stub"
        default 32
        depends on ESP_GDBSTUB_SUPPORT_TASKS
        help
            Set the number of tasks which GDB Stub will support.
