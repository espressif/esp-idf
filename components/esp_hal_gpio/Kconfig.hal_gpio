    default y
    help
        Enable this flag to use HAL functions from ROM when applicable instead of ESP-IDF.

        If keeping this as "n" in your project, you will have less free IRAM.
        When compiling an application for a CPU that cannot access to the ROM memory,
        this option should be disabled.
