    <li> Stack: &gt; 2kB (&gt; 8 kB is recommended)</li>
    <li> Dynamic data (heap): &gt; 4 KB (&gt; 48 kB is recommended if using several objects).
	    Set by <em>LV_MEM_SIZE</em> in <em>lv_conf.h</em>. </li>
    <li> Display buffer:  &gt; <em>"Horizontal resolution"</em> pixels (&gt; 10 &times; <em>"Horizontal resolution"</em> is recommended) </li>
    <li> One frame buffer in the MCU or in an external display controller</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li> C99 or newer compiler</li>

## FAQ

### Where can I ask questions?
You can ask questions in the forum: [https://forum.lvgl.io/](https://forum.lvgl.io/).

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues) for development related discussion.
You should use them only if your question or issue is tightly related to the development of the library.

Before posting a question, please ready this FAQ section as you might find answer to your issue here too.

### Is my MCU/hardware supported?
Every MCU which is capable of driving a display via parallel port, SPI, RGB interface or anything else and fulfills the [Requirements](#requirements) is supported by LVGL.

This includes:
- "Common" MCUs like STM32F, STM32H, NXP Kinetis, LPC, iMX, dsPIC33, PIC32, SWM341 etc.
- Bluetooth, GSM, Wi-Fi modules like Nordic NRF and Espressif ESP32
- Linux with frame buffer device such as /dev/fb0. This includes Single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi
- Anything else with a strong enough MCU and a peripheral to drive a display

### Is my display supported?
LVGL needs just one simple driver function to copy an array of pixels into a given area of the display.
If you can do this with your display then you can use it with LVGL.

Some examples of the supported display types:
- TFTs with 16 or 24 bit color depth
- Monitors with an HDMI port
- Small monochrome displays
- Gray-scale displays
- even LED matrices
- or any other display where you can control the color/state of the pixels

See the [Porting](/porting/display) section to learn more.

### LVGL doesn't start, randomly crashes or nothing is drawn on the display. What can be the problem?
- Try increasing `LV_MEM_SIZE`.
- Be sure `lv_disp_drv_t`, `lv_indev_drv_t` and `lv_fs_drv_t` are global or `static`.
- Be sure your display works without LVGL. E.g. paint it to red on start up.
- Enable [Logging](porting/log)
- Enable asserts in `lv_conf.h` (`LV_USE_ASSERT_...`)
- If you use an RTOS
   - increase the stack size of the task which calls `lv_timer_handler()`
   - Be sure you used a mutex as [described here](/porting/os)

### My display driver is not called. What have I missed?
Be sure you are calling `lv_tick_inc(x)` in an interrupt and `lv_timer_handler()` in your main `while(1)`.

Learn more in the [Tick](/porting/tick) and [Timer handler](/porting/timer-handler) sections.

### Why is the display driver called only once? Only the upper part of the display is refreshed.
Be sure you are calling `lv_disp_flush_ready(drv)` at the end of your "*display flush callback*".

### Why do I see only garbage on the screen?
Probably there a bug in your display driver. Try the following code without using LVGL. You should see a square with red-blue gradient.

```c
#define BUF_W 20
#define BUF_H 10

lv_color_t buf[BUF_W * BUF_H];
lv_color_t * buf_p = buf;
uint16_t x, y;
for(y = 0; y &lt; BUF_H; y++) {
    lv_color_t c = lv_color_mix(LV_COLOR_BLUE, LV_COLOR_RED, (y * 255) / BUF_H);
    for(x = 0; x &lt; BUF_W; x++){
        (*buf_p) =  c;
        buf_p++;
    }
}

lv_area_t a;
a.x1 = 10;
a.y1 = 40;
a.x2 = a.x1 + BUF_W - 1;
a.y2 = a.y1 + BUF_H - 1;
my_flush_cb(NULL, &a, buf);
```

### Why do I see nonsense colors on the screen?
Probably LVGL's color format is not compatible with your display's color format. Check `LV_COLOR_DEPTH` in *lv_conf.h*.

If you are using 16-bit colors with SPI (or another byte-oriented interface) you probably need to set `LV_COLOR_16_SWAP  1` in *lv_conf.h*.
It swaps the upper and lower bytes of the pixels.

### How to speed up my UI?
- Turn on compiler optimization and enable cache if your MCU has it
- Increase the size of the display buffer
- Use two display buffers and flush the buffer with DMA (or similar peripheral) in the background
- Increase the clock speed of the SPI or parallel port if you use them to drive the display
- If your display has an SPI port consider changing to a model with a parallel interface because it has much higher throughput
- Keep the display buffer in internal RAM (not in external SRAM) because LVGL uses it a lot and it should have a fast access time

### How to reduce flash/ROM usage?
You can disable all the unused features (such as animations, file system, GPU etc.) and object types in *lv_conf.h*.

If you are using GCC/CLANG you can add `-fdata-sections -ffunction-sections` compiler flags and `--gc-sections` linker flag to remove unused functions and variables from the final binary. If possible, add the `-flto` compiler flag to enable link-time-optimisation together with `-Os` for GCC or `-Oz` for CLANG. 

### How to reduce the RAM usage
- Lower the size of the *Display buffer*
- Reduce `LV_MEM_SIZE` in *lv_conf.h*. This memory is used when you create objects like buttons, labels, etc.
- To work with lower `LV_MEM_SIZE` you can create objects only when required and delete them when they are not needed anymore

### How to work with an operating system?

To work with an operating system where tasks can interrupt each other (preemptively) you should protect LVGL related function calls with a mutex.
See the [Operating system and interrupts](/porting/os) section to learn more.
