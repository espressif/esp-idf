# NOTE: In a case where only the default NVS partition is to be encrypted
# and no custom NVS partitions exist, `nvs_flash_init` is the only API that
# needs to be called. No API from the `nvs_sec_provider` component is called
# as neither the `nvs_flash` component nor the user app depends on it.
# Thus, the symbols from this component are not placed in the .map file and
# hence the constructor, which initialises the encryption scheme for the default
# NVS partition, never executes. The following is a workaround for the same.
