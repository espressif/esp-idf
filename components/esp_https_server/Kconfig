            Enable ESP HTTPS server component

            This enables the ESP_HTTPS_SERVER_EVENT event type. Generating these eventes adds some overhead.
            If you are not using this event type, you can disable it to save some memory.


    config ESP_HTTPS_SERVER_EVENT_POST_TIMEOUT
        int "Time in millisecond to wait for posting event"
        depends on (ESP_HTTPS_SERVER_ENABLE && ESP_HTTPS_SERVER_EVENTS)
        default 2000
        help
            This config option helps in setting the time in millisecond to wait for event to be posted to the
            system default event loop. Set it to -1 if you need to set timeout to portMAX_DELAY.

    config ESP_HTTPS_SERVER_CERT_SELECT_HOOK

        bool "Enable certificate selection hook"
        default n
        help
            Enable certificate selection hook for ESP HTTPS Server. When enabled, this allows the server to
            dynamically select the appropriate certificate based on the client's Server Name Indication (SNI).
            This is useful for hosting multiple domains on a single server with different SSL certificates.
