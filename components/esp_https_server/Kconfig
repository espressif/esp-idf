            This config option helps in setting the time in millisecond to wait for event to be posted to the
            system default event loop. Set it to -1 if you need to set timeout to portMAX_DELAY.

        help
            Enable certificate selection hook for ESP HTTPS Server. When enabled, this allows the server to
            dynamically select the appropriate certificate based on the client's Server Name Indication (SNI).
            This is useful for hosting multiple domains on a single server with different SSL certificates.
