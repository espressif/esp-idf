            The ESP-TLS APIs support multiple backend TLS libraries. Currently mbedTLS and WolfSSL are
            supported. Different TLS libraries may support different features and have different resource
            usage. Consult the ESP-TLS documentation in ESP-IDF Programming guide for more details.

            After enabling this option the esp-tls client will skip the server certificate verification
            by default. Note that this option will only modify the default behaviour of esp-tls client
            regarding server cert verification. The default behaviour should only be applicable when
            no other option regarding the server cert verification is opted in the esp-tls config
            (e.g. crt_bundle_attach, use_global_ca_store etc.).
            WARNING : Enabling this option comes with a potential risk of establishing a TLS connection
            with a server which has a fake identity, provided that the server certificate
            is not provided either through API or other mechanism like ca_store etc.
