// The HAL layer for SDIO slave (common part)

// SDIO slave HAL usages:

/*
Architecture:

The whole SDIO slave peripheral consists of three parts: the registers (including the interrupt
control and shared registers), a send FIFO, and a receive FIFO. The document
``esp_slave_protocol.rst`` describes the functionality of the peripheral in detail. An SDIO host
will only ever access one of the three parts at any one time, thus the hardware functionality of
the SDIO slave peripheral are completely independent. Likewise, this HAL is organized in such a
fashion as to correspond to the three independent parts.

The shared registers are quite simple: the slave can directly access them from the internal data
bus, while the host can access them by CMD52/53 with the correct address. As for the interrupts:
when an SDIO host interrupts the SDIO slave peripheral (by writing a command), the corresponding
bit in the interrupt register will be set; when the SDIO slave peripheral needs to interrupt the
host, it write some register to cause the host interrupt bit being set, and the slave hardware
will output the interrupt signal on the DAT1 line.

For the FIFOs, the peripheral provides counters as registers so that the host can always know whether the slave
is ready to send/receive data. The HAL resets the counters during initialization, and the host should somehow
inform the slave to reset the counters again if it should reboot (or lose the counter value for some reasons).
Then the host can read/write the FIFOs by CMD53 commands according to the counters.

In order to avoid copying data to/from the FIFOs or memory buffers each time, the HAL layer
contains a descriptor queue (implemented as linked-list) that allows descriptors of memory
buffers to be queued for transmission/reception. Once a buffer is queued, the HAL takes ownership
of the buffer until some "finish" functions successfully return, indicating the
transmission/reception of that buffer is complete. The ISR is invoked multiple times to iterate
through the queued descriptors, and also to signal to the upper layer if a buffer has been
freed.

The HAL is used as below:

- Receiving part:

    1.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_recv_start` to start the receiving DMA.

        If there are already buffers loaded, the receiving will start from those buffers first.

    2.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_recv_init_desc` with a `sdio_slave_hal_recv_desc_t` and the buffer address to
        associate the descriptor with the buffer.

        The HAL initialize this descriptors with the determined length and maybe some extra data.

    3.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_load_buf` with the initialized descriptor of the buffer to load a
        receiving buffer to the HAL.

        When the DMA is started, the descriptors is loaded onto the DMA linked-list, and the
        counter of receiving buffers is increased so that the host will know this by the
        receiving interrupt. The hardware will automatically go through the linked list and write
        data into the buffers loaded on the list.

    4.  (Optional, mandatory only when interrupt enabled) Call `sdio_slave_hal_recv_done` to check
        and clear the receiving interrupt bits.

    5.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_recv_has_next_item` to check whether there are finished buffers.

    6.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_recv_unload_desc` for the same times as
        `sdio_slave_hal_recv_has_next_item` successfully returns.

    7.  (Optional) Call `sdio_slave_hal_recv_reset_counter` to reset the counter to current loaded
        but not used buffers if you want to reset the counter only. This is available only when
        the DMA is stopped.

    8.  (Optional) Call `sdio_slave_hal_recv_flush_one_buffer` (recursively) if you want to
        discard data of one (or more) buffers and load them again. This is available only when
        the DMA is stopped.

    9.  (Optional when deinitialization) Call `sdio_slave_hal_recv_unload_desc` recursively to get
        all the buffers loaded to the HAL, no matter they are used or not. Don't do this when the
        DMA is not stopped.

- Sending part:

    The sending driver is slightly different, since we are not using the re-start feature.
    (TODO: re-write this part if the stitch mode is released)

    1.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_send_start` to start the sending DMA.

        If there is already any data queued, it will ne ready to be sent to host now.

    2.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_send_queue` to queue the data to send.

        If the interrupt is enabled, the ISR will be invoked.

    3.  (Required if interrupt enabled) Call `` to clear the interrupt bits used by the SW
        invoking logic.

    4.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_send_new_packet_if_exist` to check and send new packet (if there is
        data queued).

    5.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_send_eof_happened` to check whether the previous packet is done.

        It will also clear the interrupt status bit for this event.

    6.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_send_get_next_finished_arg` recursively to get the arguments for the
        finished buffers.

    7.  (Optional when deinitialization) Call `sdio_slave_hal_send_flush_next_buffer` recursively
        to get all buffers queued, regardless sent or not. Don't do this when the DMA is not stopped.

    8.  (Optional) Call `sdio_slave_hal_send_reset_counter` to reset the counter to current loaded
        but not sent buffers if you want to reset the counter only. Don't do this when the DMA is not
        stopped.

    Note a counter should be used when performing step 2 and 6, to make sure that the queue size
    is enough.

- Host part:

    1.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_hostint_set_ena` and `sdio_slave_hal_hostint_get_ena` to
        enable/disable the interrupt sent to master. Note that the host can also modify the same
        registers at the same time. Try to avoid using them outside the initialization process.

    2.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_hostint_send` and `sdio_slave_hal_hostint_clear` to trigger general
        purpose interrupts or cancel all kinds of interrupts send to the host. These interrupts are
        set/cleared in a concurrent-safe way, so the slave can call these functions safely.

    3.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_slvint_fetch_clear` to fetch the general purpose interrupts sent by
        the host to the slave. These interrupts will also be cleared after the calls.

    4.  Call `sdio_slave_hal_host_get_reg` and `sdio_slave_hal_host_set_reg` to read/write the
        general purpose shared between the host and slave. Note that these registers are also not
        concurrent-safe. Try not to write to the same register from two directions at the same time.
