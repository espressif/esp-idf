        help
            If "n" - No virtual mode. All eFuse operations are real and use eFuse registers.
            If "y" - The virtual mode is enabled and all eFuse operations (read and write) are redirected
            to RAM instead of eFuse registers, all permanent changes (via eFuse) are disabled.
            Log output will state changes that would be applied, but they will not be.

            If it is "y", then SECURE_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_MODE_RELEASE cannot be used.
            Because the EFUSE VIRT mode is for testing only.

            During startup, the eFuses are copied into RAM. This mode is useful for fast tests.

        help
            In addition to the "Simulate eFuse operations in RAM" option, this option just adds
            a feature to keep eFuses after reboots in flash memory. To use this mode the partition_table
            should have the `efuse` partition. partition.csv: "efuse_em, data, efuse,   ,   0x2000,"

            During startup, the eFuses are copied from flash or,
            in case if flash is empty, from real eFuse to RAM and then update flash.
            This mode is useful when need to keep changes after reboot
            (testing secure_boot and flash_encryption).
