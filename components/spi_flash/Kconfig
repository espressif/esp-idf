config SPI_FLASH_ENABLE_COUNTERS
    bool "Enable operation counters"
    default 0
    help
        This option enables the following APIs:
            spi_flash_reset_counters
            spi_flash_dump_counters
            spi_flash_get_counters
        These APIs may be used to collect performance data for spi_flash APIs
        and to help understand behaviour of libraries which use SPI flash.

config SPI_FLASH_ROM_DRIVER_PATCH
    bool "Enable SPI flash ROM driver patched functions"
    default y
    help
        Enable this flag to use patched versions of SPI flash ROM driver functions.
        This option is needed to write to flash on ESP32-D2WD, and any configuration
        where external SPI flash is connected to non-default pins.
