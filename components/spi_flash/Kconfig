    config SPI_FLASH_VERIFY_WRITE
        bool "Verify SPI flash writes"
        default n
        help
            If this option is enabled, any time SPI flash is written then the data will be read
            back and verified. This can catch hardware problems with SPI flash, or flash which
            was not erased before verification.

    config SPI_FLASH_LOG_FAILED_WRITE
        bool "Log errors if verification fails"
        depends on SPI_FLASH_VERIFY_WRITE
        default n
        help
            If this option is enabled, if SPI flash write verification fails then a log error line
            will be written with the address, expected & actual values. This can be useful when
            debugging hardware SPI flash problems.

    config SPI_FLASH_WARN_SETTING_ZERO_TO_ONE
        bool "Log warning if writing zero bits to ones"
        depends on SPI_FLASH_VERIFY_WRITE
        default n
        help
            If this option is enabled, any SPI flash write which tries to set zero bits in the flash to
            ones will log a warning. Such writes will not result in the requested data appearing identically
            in flash once written, as SPI NOR flash can only set bits to one when an entire sector is erased.
            After erasing, individual bits can only be written from one to zero.

            Note that some software (such as SPIFFS) which is aware of SPI NOR flash may write one bits as an
            optimisation, relying on the data in flash becoming a bitwise AND of the new data and any existing data.
            Such software will log spurious warnings if this option is enabled.

    config SPI_FLASH_ENABLE_COUNTERS
        bool "Enable operation counters"
        default 0
        help
            This option enables the following APIs:

            - spi_flash_reset_counters
            - spi_flash_dump_counters
            - spi_flash_get_counters

            These APIs may be used to collect performance data for spi_flash APIs
            and to help understand behaviour of libraries which use SPI flash.

    config SPI_FLASH_ROM_DRIVER_PATCH
        bool "Enable SPI flash ROM driver patched functions"
        default y
        help
            Enable this flag to use patched versions of SPI flash ROM driver functions.
            This option is needed to write to flash on ESP32-D2WD, and any configuration
            where external SPI flash is connected to non-default pins.

    choice SPI_FLASH_DANGEROUS_WRITE
        bool  "Writing to dangerous flash regions"
        default SPI_FLASH_DANGEROUS_WRITE_ABORTS
        help
            SPI flash APIs can optionally abort or return a failure code
            if erasing or writing addresses that fall at the beginning
            of flash (covering the bootloader and partition table) or that
            overlap the app partition that contains the running app.

            It is not recommended to ever write to these regions from an IDF app,
            and this check prevents logic errors or corrupted firmware memory from
            damaging these regions.

            Note that this feature *does not* check calls to the esp_rom_xxx SPI flash
            ROM functions. These functions should not be called directly from IDF
            applications.

        default n

            The implementation of SPI flash has been greatly changed in IDF v4.0.
            Enable this option to use the legacy implementation.

                Enable this to support auto detection of ISSI chips if chip vendor not directly
                given by ``chip_drv`` member of the chip struct. This adds support for variant
                chips, however will extend detecting time.

        config SPI_FLASH_SUPPORT_GD_CHIP
            bool "GigaDevice"
            default y
            help
                Enable this to support auto detection of GD (GigaDevice) chips if chip vendor not
                directly given by ``chip_drv`` member of the chip struct. If you are using Wrover
                modules, please don't disable this, otherwise your flash may not work in 4-bit
                mode.

                This adds support for variant chips, however will extend detecting time and image
                size. Note that the default chip driver supports the GD chips with product ID
                60H.
