config SPI_FLASH_VERIFY_WRITE
    bool "Verify SPI flash writes"
    default n
    help
        If this option is enabled, any time SPI flash is written then the data will be read
        back and verified. This can catch hardware problems with SPI flash, or flash which
        was not erased before verification.

config SPI_FLASH_LOG_FAILED_WRITE
    bool "Log errors if verification fails"
    depends on SPI_FLASH_VERIFY_WRITE
    default n
    help
        If this option is enabled, if SPI flash write verification fails then a log error line
        will be written with the address, expected & actual values. This can be useful when
        debugging hardware SPI flash problems.

config SPI_FLASH_WARN_SETTING_ZERO_TO_ONE
    bool "Log warning if writing zero bits to ones"
    depends on SPI_FLASH_VERIFY_WRITE
    default n
    help
        If this option is enabled, any SPI flash write which tries to set zero bits in the flash to
        ones will log a warning. Such writes will not result in the requested data appearing identically
        in flash once written, as SPI NOR flash can only set bits to one when an entire sector is erased.
        After erasing, individual bits can only be written from one to zero.

        Note that some software (such as SPIFFS) which is aware of SPI NOR flash may write one bits as an
        optimisation, relying on the data in flash becoming a bitwise AND of the new data and any existing data.
        Such software will log spurious warnings if this option is enabled.

config SPI_FLASH_ENABLE_COUNTERS
    bool "Enable operation counters"
    default 0
    help
        This option enables the following APIs:
            
        - spi_flash_reset_counters
        - spi_flash_dump_counters
        - spi_flash_get_counters
        
        These APIs may be used to collect performance data for spi_flash APIs
        and to help understand behaviour of libraries which use SPI flash.

config SPI_FLASH_ROM_DRIVER_PATCH
    bool "Enable SPI flash ROM driver patched functions"
    default y
    help
        Enable this flag to use patched versions of SPI flash ROM driver functions.
        This option is needed to write to flash on ESP32-D2WD, and any configuration
        where external SPI flash is connected to non-default pins.

choice SPI_FLASH_WRITING_DANGEROUS_REGIONS
    bool  "Writing to dangerous flash regions"
    default SPI_FLASH_WRITING_DANGEROUS_REGIONS_ABORTS
    help
        SPI flash APIs can optionally abort or return a failure code
        if erasing or writing addresses that fall at the beginning
        of flash (covering the bootloader and partition table) or that
        overlap the app partition that contains the running app.

        It is not recommended to ever write to these regions from an IDF app,
        and this check prevents logic errors or corrupted firmware memory from
        damaging these regions.

        Note that this feature *does not* check calls to the esp_rom_xxx SPI flash
        ROM functions. These functions should not be called directly from IDF
        applications.

config SPI_FLASH_WRITING_DANGEROUS_REGIONS_ABORTS
     bool "Aborts"
config SPI_FLASH_WRITING_DANGEROUS_REGIONS_FAILS
     bool "Fails"
config SPI_FLASH_WRITING_DANGEROUS_REGIONS_ALLOWED
     bool "Allowed"
