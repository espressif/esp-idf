config SPI_FLASH_ENABLE_COUNTERS
    bool "Enable operation counters"
    default 0
    help
        This option enables the following APIs:
            
        - spi_flash_reset_counters
        - spi_flash_dump_counters
        - spi_flash_get_counters
        
        These APIs may be used to collect performance data for spi_flash APIs
        and to help understand behaviour of libraries which use SPI flash.

config SPI_FLASH_ROM_DRIVER_PATCH
    bool "Enable SPI flash ROM driver patched functions"
    default y
    help
        Enable this flag to use patched versions of SPI flash ROM driver functions.
        This option is needed to write to flash on ESP32-D2WD, and any configuration
        where external SPI flash is connected to non-default pins.

choice SPI_FLASH_WRITING_DANGEROUS_REGIONS
    bool  "Writing to dangerous flash regions"
    default SPI_FLASH_WRITING_DANGEROUS_REGIONS_ABORTS
    help
        SPI flash APIs can optionally abort or return a failure code
        if erasing or writing addresses that fall at the beginning
        of flash (covering the bootloader and partition table) or that
        overlap the app partition that contains the running app.

        It is not recommended to ever write to these regions from an IDF app,
        and this check prevents logic errors or corrupted firmware memory from
        damaging these regions.

        Note that this feature *does not* check calls to the esp_rom_xxx SPI flash
        ROM functions. These functions should not be called directly from IDF
        applications.

config SPI_FLASH_WRITING_DANGEROUS_REGIONS_ABORTS
     bool "Aborts"
config SPI_FLASH_WRITING_DANGEROUS_REGIONS_FAILS
     bool "Fails"
config SPI_FLASH_WRITING_DANGEROUS_REGIONS_ALLOWED
     bool "Allowed"
