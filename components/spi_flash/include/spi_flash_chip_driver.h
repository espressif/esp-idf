/** @brief SPI flash chip driver definition structure.
 *
 * The chip driver structure contains chip-specific pointers to functions to perform SPI flash operations, and some
 * chip-specific numeric values.
 *
 * @note This is not a public API. These functions are called from the public API (declared in
 * esp_flash.h). They assume the caller has already validated arguments and enabled relevant protections
 * (disabling flash cache, prevent concurrent SPI access, etc.)
 *
 * Do not call chip driver functions directly in other contexts.
 *
 * A generic driver for generic chips and its related operations are defined in
 * spi_flash_chip_generic.h which can be used as building blocks for written
 * new/specific SPI flash chip drivers.
 *
 * @note All of these functions may be called with SPI flash cache disabled, so must only ever access IRAM/DRAM/ROM.

     * Auto-detection of a SPI flash chip calls this function in turn on each registered driver (see esp_flash_registered_flash_drivers).
     *
     * ID - as read by spi_flash_generic_read_id() - is supplied so each probe
     * function doesn't need to unnecessarily read ID, but probe is permitted
     * to interrogate flash in any non-destructive way.
     *
     * It is permissible for the driver to modify the 'chip' structure if probing succeeds (specifically, to assign something to the
     * driver_data pointer if that is useful for the driver.)
     *
     * @return ESP_OK if probing was successful, an error otherwise. Driver may
     * assume that returning ESP_OK means it has claimed this chip.
