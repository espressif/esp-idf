 *    in multithreaded environment and use OS primitives:
 *   - 'op_lock' locks access to flash API internal data.
 *   - 'op_unlock' unlocks access to flash API internal data.
 * Different versions of the guarding functions should be used depending on the context of
 * execution (with or without functional OS). In normal conditions when flash API is called
 * from task the functions use OS primitives. When there is no OS at all or when
 * it is not guaranteed that OS is functional (accessing flash from exception handler) these
