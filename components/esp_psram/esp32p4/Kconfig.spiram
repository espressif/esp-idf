            If enabled, firmware in flash including instructions and data will be moved into PSRAM on startup,
            firmware code will execute directly from PSRAM.

            With this option enabled, code that requires execution during an MSPI1 Flash operation
            does not have to be placed in IRAM. Therefore codes that need to be executing during Flash
            operations can continue working normally.

            Because P4 flash and PSRAM are using two separate SPI buses, moving flash content to PSRAM will
            actually increase the load of the PSRAM MSPI bus, so the exact impact on performance will be dependent
            on your app usage of PSRAM. For example, as the PSRAM bus speed could be much faster than flash bus speed,
            if the instructions and data that are used to be in flash are not accessed very frequently, you might
            get better performance with this option enabled. We suggest doing performance profiling to determine
            if enabling this option.

            Accessing memory in PSRAM has certain restrictions, so task stacks allocated by xTaskCreate
            are by default allocated from internal RAM.

            This option allows for passing memory allocated from PSRAM to be passed to xTaskCreateStatic.
            This should only be used for tasks where the stack is never accessed while the L2Cache is
            disabled, e.g. during SPI Flash operations
