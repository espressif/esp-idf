            If enabled, firmware in flash including instructions and data will be moved into PSRAM on startup,
            firmware code will execute directly from PSRAM.

            With this option enabled, code that requires execution during an MSPI1 Flash operation
            does not have to be placed in IRAM. Therefore codes that need to be executing during Flash
            operations can continue working normally.

            This feature is useful for high throughput peripheral involved applications to improve
            the performance during MSPI1 flash operations.
