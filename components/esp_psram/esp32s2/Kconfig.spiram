        help
            Accessing memory in SPIRAM has certain restrictions, so task stacks allocated by xTaskCreate
            are by default allocated from internal RAM.

            This option allows for passing memory allocated from SPIRAM to be passed to xTaskCreateStatic.
            This should only be used for tasks where the stack is never accessed while the cache is disabled.
