            Accessing memory in SPIRAM has certain restrictions, so task stacks allocated by xTaskCreate
            are by default allocated from internal RAM.

            This option allows for passing memory allocated from SPIRAM to be passed to xTaskCreateStatic.
            This should only be used for tasks where the stack is never accessed while the cache is disabled.

            If enabled, instructions in flash will be moved into PSRAM on startup.
            If SPIRAM_RODATA is also enabled, code that requires execution during an MSPI1 Flash operation
            can forgo being placed in IRAM. Therefore codes that need to be executing during Flash
            operation can continue working normally.

            This feature is useful for high throughput peripheral involved applications to improve
            the performance during MSPI1 flash operations. PSRAM access speed is faster than Flash access.
            So the performance is better. (see External RAM documentation for more details).

            is not necessary to be placed in IRAM. Therefore codes that need to be executing during Flash

                        increases or decreases by approximately 20 Celsius degrees (depending on the
                        chip), the accesses to / from PSRAM will crash randomly.
