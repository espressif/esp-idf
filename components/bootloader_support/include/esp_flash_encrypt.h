 * encryption is enabled in device menuconfig.

 * If FLASH_CRYPT_CNT efuse parity is 1 (ie odd number of bits set),
 * then return ESP_OK immediately (indicating flash encryption is enabled
 * and functional).
 *
 * If FLASH_CRYPT_CNT efuse parity is 0 (ie even number of bits set),
 * assume the flash has just been written with plaintext that needs encrypting.
 *
 * The following regions of flash are encrypted in place:
 *
 * - The bootloader image, if a valid plaintext image is found.[*]
 * - The partition table, if a valid plaintext table is found.
 * - Any app partition that contains a valid plaintext app image.
 * - Any other partitions with the "encrypt" flag set. [**]
 *
 * After the re-encryption process completes, a '1' bit is added to the
 * FLASH_CRYPT_CNT value (setting the parity to 1) and the EFUSE is re-burned.
 *
 * [*] If reflashing bootloader with secure boot enabled, pre-encrypt
 * the bootloader before writing it to flash or secure boot will fail.
 *
 * [**] For this reason, if serial re-flashing a previous flashed
 * device with secure boot enabled and using FLASH_CRYPT_CNT to
 * trigger re-encryption, you must simultaneously re-flash plaintext
 * content to all partitions with the "encrypt" flag set or this
 * data will be corrupted (encrypted twice).
 *
 * @note The post-condition of this function is that all
 * partitions that should be encrypted are encrypted.
 *
 * @note Take care not to power off the device while this function
 * is running, or the partition currently being encrypted will be lost.
 *
 * @note RTC_WDT will reset while encryption operations will be performed (if RTC_WDT is configured).
 *
 * @return ESP_OK if all operations succeeded, ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE
 * if a fatal error occured during encryption of all partitions.
