            In order to view these, your terminal program must support ANSI color codes.

        help
            Choose what sort of timestamp is displayed in the log output:

            - "None" - The log will only contain the actual log messages themselves
              without any time-related information. Avoiding timestamps can help conserve
              processing power and memory. It might useful when you
              perform log analysis or debugging, sometimes it's more straightforward
              to work with logs that lack timestamps, especially if the time of occurrence
              is not critical for understanding the issues.

            - "Milliseconds since boot" is calculated from the RTOS tick count multiplied
              by the tick period. This time will reset after a software reboot.
              e.g. (90000)

            - "System time (HH:MM:SS.sss)" is taken from POSIX time functions which use the chip's
              RTC and high resolution timers to maintain an accurate time. The system time is
              initialized to 0 on startup, it can be set with an SNTP sync, or with
              POSIX time functions. This time will not reset after a software reboot.
              e.g. (00:01:30.000)

            - "System time (YY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.sss)" it is the same as the above,
              but also prints the date as well.

            - NOTE: Currently this will not get used in logging from binary blobs
              (i.e WiFi & Bluetooth libraries), these will always print
              milliseconds since boot.
