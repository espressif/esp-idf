            Select this option to use MbedTLS crypto API's which utilize hardware acceleration.

            Select this option to print logging information from WPA supplicant,
            this includes handshake information and key hex dumps depending
            on the project logging level.

            Enabling this could increase the build size ~60kb
            depending on the project logging level.

        default n
        help
            Select this option to enable WPS related IOT fixes with
            different APs. This option fixes IOT related issues with
            APs which do not follow some of the standards of WPS-2.0
            specification. These do not include any of the security
            related bypassing, just simple configuration corrections.

            Current fixes under this flag.
            1. Allow NULL-padded WPS attributes: Some APs keep NULL-padding
            at the end of some variable length WPS Attributes.
            This is not as par the WPS2.0 specs, but to avoid interop issues,
            ignore the padding by reducing the attribute length by 1.
            2. Bypass WPS-Config method validation: Some APs set display/pbc
            button bit without setting virtual/phycial display/button bit which
            will cause M2 validation fail, bypassing WPS-Config method validation.
