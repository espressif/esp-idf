            Enable this option with BTM and RRM enabled in sta config
            to make device ready for network assisted roaming.
            BTM: BSS transition management enables an AP to request a station to transition
            to a specific AP, or to indicate to a station a set of preferred APs.
            RRM: Radio measurements enable STAs to understand the radio environment,
            it enables STAs to observe and gather data on radio link performance
            and on the radio environment. Current implementation adds beacon report,
            link measurement, neighbor report.
