/*******************************************************************************
 * SPI Bus Lock for arbitration among SPI master (intr, polling) trans, SPI flash operations and
 * flash/psram cache access.
 *
 * NON-PUBLIC API. Don't use it directly in applications.
 *
 * There is the main lock corresponding to an SPI bus, of which several devices (holding child
 * locks) attaching to it. Each of the device is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to be used in only one task
 * to avoid concurrency issues.
 *
 * Terms:
 * - BG operations (BackGround operations) means some transaction that will not immediately /
 *   explicitly be sent in the task. It can be some cache access, or interrupt transactions.
 *
 * - Operation: usage of the bus, for example, do SPI transactions.
 *
 * - Acquiring processor: the task or the ISR that is allowed to use the bus. No operations will be
 *   performed if there is no acquiring processor. A processor becomes the acquiring processor if
 *   it ask for that when no acquiring processor exist, otherwise it has to wait for the acquiring
 *   processor to handle over the role to it. The acquiring processor will and will only assign one
 *   acquiring processor in the waiting list (if not empty) when it finishes its operation.
 *
 * - Acquiring device: the only device allowed to use the bus. Operations can be performed in
 *   either the BG or the task. When there's no acquiring device, only the ISR is allowed to be the
 *   acquiring processor and perform operations on the bus.
 *
 * When a device wants to perform operations, it either:
 * 1. Acquire the bus, and operate in the task (e.g. polling transactions of SPI master, and SPI flash
 *    operations)
 *
 * 2. Request a BG operation. And the ISR will be enabled at proper time.
 *
 *    For example if a task wants to send an interrupt transaction, it prepares the data in the task,
 *    call `spi_bus_lock_bg_request`, and handle sending in the ISR.
 *
 * 3. When a device has already acquired the bus, BG operations are also allowed. After the
 *    `spi_bus_lock_bg_request` is called, call `spi_bus_lock_wait_bg_done` before operations in task
 *    again to wait until BG operations are done.
 *
 * Any device may try to invoke the ISR (by `spi_bus_lock_bg_request`). The ISR will be invoked and
 * become the acquiring processor immediately when the bus is not acquired by other processors. Any
 * device may also try to acquire the bus (by `spi_bus_lock_acquire_start`). The device will become
 * the acquiring processor immediately when the bus is not acquired and there is no request active.
 *
 * The acquiring processor must be aware of its acquiring role, and properly transfer the acquiring
 * processor to other tasks or ISR when they have nothing else to do. Before picking a new
 * acquiring processor, a new acquiring device must be picked first, if there are other devices,
 * asking to be acquiring device. After that, the new acquiring processor is picked by the sequence
 * below:
 *
 * 1. If there is an acquiring device:
 *      1.1 The ISR, if acquiring device has active BG requests
 *      1.2 The task of the device, if no active BG request for the device
 * 2. The ISR, if there's no acquiring device, but any BG request is active
 * 3. No one becomes the acquiring processor
 *
 * The API also helps on the arbitration of SPI cs lines. The bus is initialized with a cs_num
 * argument. When attaching devices onto the bus with `spi_bus_lock_register_dev`, it will allocate
 * devices with different device ID according to the flags given. If the ID is smaller than the
 * cs_num given when bus is initialized, error will be returned.
 *
 * Usage:
 * * Initialization:
 * 1. Call `spi_bus_init_lock` to register a lock for a bus.
 * 2. Call `spi_bus_lock_set_bg_control` to prepare BG enable/disable functions for
 *    the lock.
 * 3. Call `spi_bus_lock_register_dev` for each devices that may make use of the
 *    bus, properly store the returned handle, representing those devices.
 *
 * * Acquiring:
 * 1. Call `spi_bus_lock_acquire_start` when a device wants to use the bus
 * 2. Call `spi_bus_lock_touch` to mark the bus as touched by this device. Also check if the bus
 *    has been touched by other devices.
 * 3. (optional) Do something on the bus...
 * 4. (optional) Call `spi_bus_lock_bg_request` to inform and invoke the BG. See ISR below about
 *    ISR operations.
 * 5. (optional) If `spi_bus_lock_bg_request` is done, you have to call `spi_bus_lock_wait_bg_done`
 *    before touching the bus again, or do the following steps.
 * 6. Call `spi_bus_lock_acquire_end` to release the bus to other devices.
 *
 * * ISR:
 * 1. Call `spi_bus_lock_bg_entry` when entering the ISR, run or skip the closure for the previous
 *    operation according to the return value.
 * 2. Call `spi_bus_lock_get_acquiring_dev` to get the acquiring device. If there is no acquiring
 *    device, call `spi_bus_lock_bg_check_dev_acq` to check and update a new acquiring device.
 * 3. Call `spi_bus_lock_bg_check_dev_req` to check for request of the desired device. If the
 *    desired device is not requested, go to step 5.
 * 4. Check, start operation for the desired device and go to step 6; otherwise if no operations
 *    can be performed, call `spi_bus_lock_bg_clear_req` to clear the request for this device. If
 *    `spi_bus_lock_bg_clear_req` is called and there is no BG requests active, goto step 6.
 * 5. (optional) If the device is the acquiring device, go to step 6, otherwise
 *    find another desired device, and go back to step 3.
 * 6. Call `spi_bus_lock_bg_exit` to try quitting the ISR. If failed, go back to step 2 to look for
 *    a new request again. Otherwise, quit the ISR.
 *
 * * Deinitialization (optional):
 * 1. Call `spi_bus_lock_unregister_dev` for each device when they are no longer needed.
 * 2. Call `spi_bus_deinit_lock` to release the resources occupied by the lock.
 *
 * Some technical details:
 *
 * The child-lock of each device will have its own Binary Semaphore, which allows the task serving
 * this device (task A) being blocked when it fail to become the acquiring processor while it's
 * calling `spi_bus_lock_acquire_start` or `spi_bus_lock_wait_bg_done`. If it is blocked, there
 * must be an acquiring processor (either the ISR or another task (task B)), is doing transaction
 * on the bus. After that, task A will get unblocked and become the acquiring processor when the
 * ISR call `spi_bus_lock_bg_resume_acquired_dev`, or task B call `spi_bus_lock_acquire_end`.
 *
 * When the device wants to send ISR transaction, it should call `spi_bus_lock_bg_request` after
 * the data is prepared. This function sets a request bit in the critical resource. The ISR will be
 * invoked and become the new acquiring processor, when:
 *
 * 1. A task calls `spi_bus_lock_bg_request` while there is no acquiring processor;
 * 2. A tasks calls `spi_bus_lock_bg_request` while the task is the acquiring processor. Then the
 *    acquiring processor is handled over to the ISR;
 * 3. A tasks who is the acquiring processor release the bus by calling `spi_bus_lock_acquire_end`,
 *    and the ISR happens to be the next acquiring processor.
 *
 * The ISR will check (by `spi_bus_lock_bg_check_dev_req`) and clear a request bit (by
 * `spi_bus_lock_bg_clear_req`) after it confirm that all the requests of the corresponding device
 * are served. The request bit supports being written to recursively, which means, the task don't
 * need to wait for `spi_bus_lock_bg_clear_req` before call another `spi_bus_lock_bg_request`. The
 * API will handle the concurrency conflicts properly.
 *
 * The `spi_bus_lock_bg_exit` (together with `spi_bus_lock_bg_entry` called before)` is responsible
 * to ensure ONE and ONLY ONE of the following will happen when the ISR try to give up its
 * acquiring processor rule:
 *
 * 1. ISR quit, no any task unblocked while the interrupt disabled, and none of the BG bits is
 *    active.
 * 2. ISR quit, there is an acquiring device, and the acquiring processor is passed to the task
 *    serving the acquiring device by unblocking the task.
 * 3. The ISR failed to quit and have to try again.
