 *        which means more appropriate coefficients are likely to exist.
 *        But this algorithm can meet almost all the cases and the accuracy can be guaranteed as well.
 * @note  The APLL frequency is only allowed to set when there is only one peripheral refer to it.
 *        If APLL is already set by another peripheral, this function will return `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`
