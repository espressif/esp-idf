                When the chip exits deep sleep, the CPU and the flash chip are powered on
                at the same time. CPU will run deep sleep stub first, and then
                proceed to load code from flash. Some flash chips need sufficient
                time to pass between power on and first read operation. By default,
                without any extra delay, this time is approximately 900us, although
                some flash chip types need more than that.

                By default extra delay is set to 2000us. When optimizing startup time
                for applications which require it, this value may be reduced.

                If you are seeing "flash read err, 1000" message printed to the
                console after deep sleep reset, try increasing this value.
