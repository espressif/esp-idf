                If enabled, chip will try to power down flash as part of esp_light_sleep_start(), which costs
                more time when chip wakes up. Can only be enabled if there is no SPIRAM configured.
                This option will in fact consider VDD_SDIO auto power value (ESP_PD_OPTION_AUTO) as OFF. Also, it is
                possible to force a power domain to stay ON during light sleep by using esp_sleep_pd_config()
                function.

                esp32c3 and esp32s3 will reset at wake-up if GPIO is received a small electrostatic
                pulse during light sleep, with specific condition

                - GPIO needs to be configured as input-mode only
                - The pin receives a small electrostatic pulse, and reset occurs when the pulse
                  voltage is higher than 6 V

                For GPIO set to input mode only, it is not a good practice to leave it open/floating,
                The hardware design needs to controlled it with determined supply or ground voltage
                is necessary.

                This option provides a software workaround for this issue. Configure to isolate all
                GPIO pins in sleep state.

                When the chip goes sleep or software reset, the clock source would change to XTAL
                and switch off the BBPLL clock for saving power. However, this might make the
                USB_SERIAL_JTAG down which depends on BBPLL as its unique clock source.
                Therefore, this is used for keeping bbpll clock always on when USB_SERIAL_JTAG PORT is using.
                If you want to use USB_SERIAL_JTAG under sw_reset case or sleep-wakeup case, you shoule select
                this option. But be aware that this might increase the power consumption.
