                If enabled, chip will try to power down flash as part of esp_light_sleep_start(), which costs
                more time when chip wakes up. Can only be enabled if there is no SPIRAM configured.
                This option will in fact consider VDD_SDIO auto power value (ESP_PD_OPTION_AUTO) as OFF. Also, it is
                possible to force a power domain to stay ON during light sleep by using esp_sleep_pd_config()
                function.
