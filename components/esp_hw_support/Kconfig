                When the chip exits sleep, the CPU and the flash chip are powered on at the same time.
                CPU will run rom code (deepsleep) or ram code (lightsleep) first, and then load or execute
                code from flash.

                Some flash chips need sufficient time to pass between power on and first read operation.
                By default, without any extra delay, this time is approximately 900us, although
                some flash chip types need more than that.

                (!!! Please adjust this value according to the Data Sheet of SPI Flash used in your project.)
                In Flash Data Sheet, the parameters that define the Flash ready timing after power-up (minimum
                time from Vcc(min) to CS activeare) usually named tVSL in ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS chapter,
                and the configuration value here should be:
                ESP_SLEEP_WAIT_FLASH_READY_EXTRA_DELAY = tVSL - 900

                For esp32 and esp32s3, the default extra delay is set to 2000us. When optimizing startup time
                for applications which require it, this value may be reduced.

                If you are seeing "flash read err, 1000" message printed to the console after deep sleep reset
                on esp32, or triggered RTC_WDT/LP_WDT after lightsleep wakeup, try increasing this value.
                (For esp32, the delay will be executed in both deep sleep and light sleep wake up flow.
                For chips after esp32, the delay will be executed only in light sleep flow, the delay
                controlled by the EFUSE_FLASH_TPUW in ROM will be executed in deepsleep wake up flow.)

                in your callbacks.

                NOTE: Enabling these callbacks may change sleep duration calculations based on time spent in
                callback and hence it is highly recommended to keep them as short as possible.
