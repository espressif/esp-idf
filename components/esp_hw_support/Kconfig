                If enabled, chip will try to power down flash as part of esp_light_sleep_start(), which costs
                more time when chip wakes up. Can only be enabled if there is no SPIRAM configured.

                This option will power down flash under a strict but relatively safe condition. Also, it is possible to
                power down flash under a relaxed condition by using esp_sleep_pd_config() to set ESP_PD_DOMAIN_VDDSDIO
                to ESP_PD_OPTION_OFF. It should be noted that there is a risk in powering down flash, you can refer
                `ESP-IDF Programming Guide/API Reference/System API/Sleep Modes/Power-down of Flash` for more details.

                pulse during light sleep, with specific condition

                - GPIO needs to be configured as input-mode only
                - The pin receives a small electrostatic pulse, and reset occurs when the pulse
                  voltage is higher than 6 V

                is necessary.

                This option provides a software workaround for this issue. Configure to isolate all
                GPIO pins in sleep state.

                When software switches the CPU clock source from BBPLL clock to XTAL, usually the BBPLL will be
                switched off. This helps to save some power consumption in sleep modes. However this may also happen
                during the software reset, resulting in the inactive (disconnected from host) of the USB_SERIAL_JTAG
                device during software reset.

                When USB_SERIAL_JTAG is being used, whether to turn off the clock source during software reset and in
                sleep modes is determined by RTC_CLOCK_BBPLL_POWER_ON_WITH_USB.

                  - When RTC_CLOCK_BBPLL_POWER_ON_WITH_USB is enabled, the clock will be kept, so that the
                    USB_SERIAL_JTAG will keep alive during software reset. The side-effect is the increasing of power
                    consumption during sleep modes, even though USB_SERIAL_JTAG will not work in sleep modes.

                  - When RTC_CLOCK_BBPLL_POWER_ON_WITH_USB is disabled, the clock will be turned off. USB_SERIAL_JTAG
                    will be inactive during software reset and in sleep modes. This saves some power consumption in
                    sleep modes.

                When USB_SERIAL_JTAG is not being used, software will always turn off BBPLL regardless of
                RTC_CLOCK_BBPLL_POWER_ON_WITH_USB is set or not.
