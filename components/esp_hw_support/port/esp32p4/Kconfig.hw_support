        Select this option to support ESP32-P4 revisions 0.x and 1.x.
        Revisions higher than 3.0 (included) and revisions less than 3.0
        have huge hardware difference.
        Revisions higher than 3.0 (included) is not compatible with 0.x and 1.x.

    help
        Required minimum chip revision. ESP-IDF will check for it and
        reject to boot if the chip revision fails the check.
        This ensures the chip used will have some modifications (features, or bugfixes).

        The complied binary will only support chips above this revision,
        this will also help to reduce binary size.
