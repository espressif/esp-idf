        When the startup code initializes RTC_SLOW_CLK, it can perform
        calibration by comparing the RTC_SLOW_CLK frequency with main XTAL
        frequency. This option sets the number of RTC_SLOW_CLK cycles measured
        by the calibration routine. Higher numbers increase calibration
        precision, which may be important for applications which spend a lot of
        time in deep sleep. Lower numbers reduce startup time.

        When this option is set to 0, clock calibration will not be performed at
        startup, and approximate clock frequencies will be assumed:

        - 150000 Hz if internal RC oscillator is used as clock source. For this use value 1024.
        - 32768 Hz if the 32k crystal oscillator is used. For this use value 3000 or more.
            In case more value will help improve the definition of the launch of the crystal.
            If the crystal could not start, it will be switched to internal RC.

    help
        Choose which clock is used as RTC fast clock source.

        Choosing the faster 40 MHz XTAL can allow modules which depend on RTC_FAST
        to work at a higher clock frequency. With this the ULP LP-Core will run with a
        CPU frequency of 40 Mhz instead of the default 20 Mhz.

        The drawback is that the XTAL is usually powered down during sleep, as
        it draw a lot of power. Choosing this option will cause the XTAL to stay
        powered on, increasing sleep power consumption.
