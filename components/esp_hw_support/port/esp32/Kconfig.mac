    help
        Configure the number of universally administered (by IEEE) MAC addresses.
        During initialization, MAC addresses for each network interface are generated or derived from a
        single base MAC address.
        If the number of universal MAC addresses is four, all four interfaces (WiFi station, WiFi softap,
        Bluetooth and Ethernet) receive a universally administered MAC address. These are generated
        sequentially by adding 0, 1, 2 and 3 (respectively) to the final octet of the base MAC address.
        If the number of universal MAC addresses is two, only two interfaces (WiFi station and Bluetooth)
        receive a universally administered MAC address. These are generated sequentially by adding 0
        and 1 (respectively) to the base MAC address. The remaining two interfaces (WiFi softap and Ethernet)
        receive local MAC addresses. These are derived from the universal WiFi station and Bluetooth MAC
        addresses, respectively.
        When using the default (Espressif-assigned) base MAC address, either setting can be used. When using
        a custom universal MAC address range, the correct setting will depend on the allocation of MAC
        addresses in this range (either 2 or 4 per device.)
