        Choose which clock is used as RTC clock source.

        - "Internal 90kHz oscillator" option provides lowest deep sleep current
            consumption, and does not require extra external components. However
            frequency stability with respect to temperature is poor, so time may
            drift in deep/light sleep modes.
        - "External 32kHz crystal" provides better frequency stability, at the
            expense of slightly higher (1uA) deep sleep current consumption.
        - "External 32kHz oscillator" allows using 32kHz clock generated by an
            external circuit. In this case, external clock signal must be connected
            to 32K_XP pin. Amplitude should be <1.2V in case of sine wave signal,
            and <1V in case of square wave signal. Common mode voltage should be
            0.1 < Vcm < 0.5Vamp, where Vamp is the signal amplitude.
        - "Internal 8MHz oscillator divided by 256" option results in higher
            deep sleep current (by 5uA) but has better frequency stability than
            the internal 90kHz oscillator. It does not require external components.

        When the startup code initializes RTC_SLOW_CLK, it can perform
        calibration by comparing the RTC_SLOW_CLK frequency with main XTAL
        frequency. This option sets the number of RTC_SLOW_CLK cycles measured
        by the calibration routine. Higher numbers increase calibration
        precision, which may be important for applications which spend a lot of
        time in deep sleep. Lower numbers reduce startup time.

        When this option is set to 0, clock calibration will not be performed at
        startup, and approximate clock frequencies will be assumed:

        - 90000 Hz if internal RC oscillator is used as clock source. For this use value 1024.
        - 32768 Hz if the 32k crystal oscillator is used. For this use value 3000 or more.
            In case more value will help improve the definition of the launch of the crystal.
            If the crystal could not start, it will be switched to internal RC.

        Increase this option if the 32k crystal oscillator
        does not start and switches to internal RC.
