    help
        Configure the number of universally administered (by IEEE) MAC addresses.
        During initialization, MAC addresses for each network interface are generated or derived from a
        single base MAC address.
        If the number of universal MAC addresses is Two, all interfaces (WiFi station, WiFi softap) receive a
        universally administered MAC address. They are generated sequentially by adding 0, and 1 (respectively)
        to the final octet of the base MAC address. If the number of universal MAC addresses is one,
        only WiFi station receives a universally administered MAC address.
        It's generated by adding 0 to the base MAC address.
        The WiFi softap receives local MAC addresses. It's derived from the universal WiFi station MAC addresses.
        When using the default (Espressif-assigned) base MAC address, either setting can be used. When using
        a custom universal MAC address range, the correct setting will depend on the allocation of MAC
        addresses in this range (either 1 or 2 per device.)
