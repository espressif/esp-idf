            Ensure the I2C interrupt is IRAM-Safe by allowing the interrupt handler to be
            executable when the cache is disabled (e.g. SPI Flash write).
            note: This cannot be used in the I2C legacy driver.

            Wether to enable the debug log message for I2C driver.
            Note that this option only controls the I2C driver log, will not affect other drivers.
