        Enable this flag to use HAL functions from ROM instead of ESP-IDF.

        If keeping this as "n" in your project, you will have less free IRAM.
        If making this as "y" in your project, you will increase free IRAM,
        but you will lose the possibility to debug this module, and some new
        features will be added and bugs will be fixed in the IDF source
        but cannot be synced to ROM.
