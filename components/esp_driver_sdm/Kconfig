        bool "Place SDM control functions into IRAM"
        default n
        help
            Place SDM control functions (like set_duty) into IRAM,
            so that these functions can be IRAM-safe and able to be called in the other IRAM interrupt context.
            Enabling this option can improve driver performance as well.

        bool "Suppress legacy driver deprecated warning"

        help
            whether to suppress the deprecation warnings when using legacy sigma delta driver.
            If you want to continue using the legacy driver, and don't want to see related deprecation warnings,
            you can enable this option.

    config SDM_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG
        bool "Enable debug log"
        default n
        help
            whether to enable the debug log message for SDM driver.
            Note that, this option only controls the SDM driver log, won't affect other drivers.
