        help
            Place SDM control functions (like set_pulse_density) into IRAM,
            so that these functions can be IRAM-safe and able to be called in the other IRAM interrupt context.
            Enabling this option can improve driver performance as well.

    config SDM_OBJ_CACHE_SAFE
        bool
        default n
        help
            This will ensure the SDM object will not be allocated from a memory region
            where its cache can be disabled.

    config SDM_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG
        bool "Force enable debug log"
        default n
        help
            If enabled, SDM driver will:
            1. ignore the global logging settings
            2. compile all log messages into the binary
            3. set the runtime log level to VERBOSE
            Please enable this option by caution, as it will increase the binary size.
