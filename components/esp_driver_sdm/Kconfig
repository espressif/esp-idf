            Place SDM control functions (like set_duty) into IRAM,
            so that these functions can be IRAM-safe and able to be called in the other IRAM interrupt context.
            Enabling this option can improve driver performance as well.

            whether to enable the debug log message for SDM driver.
            Note that, this option only controls the SDM driver log, won't affect other drivers.
