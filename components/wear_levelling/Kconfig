       Sector size used by wear levelling library.
       You can set default sector size or size that will
       fit to the flash device sector size.
       
       With sector size set to 4096 bytes, wear levelling library is more
       efficient. However if FAT filesystem is used on top of wear levelling
       library, it will need more temporary storage: 4096 bytes for each
       mounted filesystem and 4096 bytes for each opened file.
       
       With sector size set to 512 bytes, wear levelling library will perform
       more operations with flash memory, but less RAM will be used by FAT
       filesystem library (512 bytes for the filesystem and 512 bytes for each
       file opened).

       Specify the mode to store data into flash:
       
       - In Performance mode a data will be stored to the RAM and then 
         stored back to the flash. Compared to the Safety mode, this operation is
         faster, but if power will be lost when erase sector operation is in
         progress, then the data from complete flash device sector will be lost.
       
       - In Safety mode data from complete flash device sector will be read from
         flash, modified, and then stored back to flash.
         Compared to the Performance mode, this operation is slower, but if 
         power is lost during erase sector operation, then the data from full
         flash device sector will not be lost.
