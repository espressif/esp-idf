        Select() related functions might produce an unconveniently lot of
        debug outputs when one sets the default log level to DEBUG or higher.
        It is possible to suppress these debug outputs by enabling this
        option.

config SUPPORT_TERMIOS

    default y
    help
        Disabling this option can save memory when the support for termios.h is not required.
