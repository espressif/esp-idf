            If enabled, the following functions are provided by the VFS component.

            open, close, read, write, pread, pwrite, lseek, fstat, fsync, ioctl, fcntl

            Filesystem drivers can then be registered to handle these functions
            for specific paths.

            Disabling this option can save memory when the support for these functions
            is not required.

            Note that the following functions can still be used with socket file descriptors
            when this option is disabled:

            close, read, write, ioctl, fcntl.

        help
            If enabled, select function is provided by the VFS component, and can be used
            on peripheral file descriptors (such as UART) and sockets at the same time.

            If disabled, the default select implementation will be provided by LWIP for
            sockets only.

            Disabling this option can reduce code size if support for "select" on UART file
            descriptors is not required.

            Select() related functions might produce an unconveniently lot of
            debug outputs when one sets the default log level to DEBUG or higher.
            It is possible to suppress these debug outputs by enabling this
            option.

            Disabling this option can save memory when the support for termios.h is not required.
