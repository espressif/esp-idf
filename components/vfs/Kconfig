        help
            Select() related functions might produce an unconveniently lot of
            debug outputs when one sets the default log level to DEBUG or higher.
            It is possible to suppress these debug outputs by enabling this
            option.

    config SUPPORT_TERMIOS
        bool "Add support for termios.h"
        default y
        help
            Disabling this option can save memory when the support for termios.h is not required.
