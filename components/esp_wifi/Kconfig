            Set the number of WiFi dynamic RX buffers, 0 means unlimited RX buffers will be allocated
            (provided sufficient free RAM). The size of each dynamic RX buffer depends on the size of
            the received data frame.

            For each received data frame, the WiFi driver makes a copy to an RX buffer and then delivers
            it to the high layer TCP/IP stack. The dynamic RX buffer is freed after the higher layer has
            successfully received the data frame.

            For some applications, WiFi data frames may be received faster than the application can
            process them. In these cases we may run out of memory if RX buffer number is unlimited (0).

            If a dynamic RX buffer limit is set, it should be at least the number of static RX buffers.

            has been sent by the WiFi driver. The size of each dynamic TX buffer depends on the length
            of each data frame sent by the TCP/IP layer.

            ESP-MESH utilizes beacon frames to detect and resolve root node conflicts (see documentation). However the
            default length of a beacon frame can simultaneously hold only five root node identifier structures,
            meaning that a root node conflict of up to five nodes can be detected at one time. In the occurence of
            more root nodes conflict involving more than five root nodes, the conflict resolution process will detect
            five of the root nodes, resolve the conflict, and re-detect more root nodes. This process will repeat
            until all root node conflicts are resolved. However this process can generally take a very long time.

            To counter this situation, the beacon frame length can be increased such that more root nodes can be
            detected simultaneously. Each additional root node will require 36 bytes and should be added ontop of the
            default beacon frame length of
            752 bytes. For example, if you want to detect 10 root nodes simultaneously, you need to set the beacon
            frame length as
            932 (752+36*5).

            Setting a longer beacon length also assists with debugging as the conflicting root nodes can be identified
            more quickly.
