            If enabled, WiFi & Bluetooth coexistence is controlled by software rather than hardware.
            Recommended for heavy traffic scenarios. Both coexistence configuration options are
            automatically managed, no user intervention is required.
            If only Bluetooth is used, it is recommended to disable this option to reduce binary file
            size.

        help
            If enabled, HW External coexistence arbitration is managed by GPIO pins.
            It can support three types of wired combinations so far which are 1-wired/2-wired/3-wired.
            User can select GPIO pins in application code with configure interfaces.

            This function depends on BT-off
            because currently we do not support external coex and internal coex simultaneously.
