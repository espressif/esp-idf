            Ensure the RMT interrupt is IRAM-Safe by allowing the interrupt handler to be
            executable when the cache is disabled (e.g. SPI Flash write).

    config RMT_RECV_FUNC_IN_IRAM
        bool "Place RMT receive function into IRAM"
        default n
        select GDMA_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM if SOC_RMT_SUPPORT_DMA # RMT needs to start the GDMA in the receive function
        help
            Place RMT receive function into IRAM,
            so that the receive function can be IRAM-safe and able to be called when the flash cache is disabled.
            Enabling this option can improve driver performance as well.

    config RMT_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATE_WARN
        bool "Suppress legacy driver deprecated warning"

        help
            Wether to suppress the deprecation warnings when using legacy rmt driver (driver/rmt.h).
            If you want to continue using the legacy driver, and don't want to see related deprecation warnings,
            you can enable this option.

    config RMT_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG
        bool "Enable debug log"
        default n
        help
            Wether to enable the debug log message for RMT driver.
            Note that, this option only controls the RMT driver log, won't affect other drivers.
