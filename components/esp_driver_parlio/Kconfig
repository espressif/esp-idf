            Wether to enable the debug log message for parallel IO driver.
            Note that, this option only controls the parallel IO driver log, won't affect other drivers.

        select GDMA_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM # the driver needs to start the GDMA in the interrupt
        help
            Ensure the Parallel IO interrupt is IRAM-Safe by allowing the interrupt handler to be
            executable when the cache is disabled (e.g. SPI Flash write).
