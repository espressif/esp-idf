            whether to enable the debug log message for parallel IO driver.
            Note that, this option only controls the parallel IO driver log, won't affect other drivers.

        help
            Ensure the Parallel IO interrupt is IRAM-Safe by allowing the interrupt handler to be
            executable when the cache is disabled (e.g. SPI Flash write).
