## ESP-TEE: Test Suite

- ESP-TEE utilizes the `pytest` framework in ESP-IDF for executing the dedicated unit tests on the target. The test application includes cases spanning the following modules -
    - Secure service call interface
    - Interrupts and exception handling
    - Privilege violation
    - Cryptographic operations
    - TEE OTA updates
    - Secure storage
    - Attestation

- For executing the test locally, ESP-IDF needs to be installed with the additional Python requirements.

```bash
cd $IDF_PATH
bash install.sh --enable-ci
. ./export.sh
```

- For example, to execute the TEE test suite for ESP32-C6 with all the available `sdkconfig` files, run the following steps. The required test applications will be built and flashed automatically onto the DUT by the `pytest` framework.

```bash
idf-ci build run --target esp32c6 --only-test-related
pytest --target esp32c6
```
