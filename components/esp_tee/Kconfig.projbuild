        depends on SECURE_ENABLE_TEE
        default n
        help
            This configuration restricts access to TEE-reserved regions in external flash
            by making them inaccessible to the REE via the SPI1 interface (physical addresses).

            With this enabled, all SPI flash read, write, or erase operations over SPI1 will
            be routed through service calls to the TEE, introducing additional performance
            overhead.

            When Flash Encryption (SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED) is enabled, the REE can still
            access TEE-related flash partitions over SPI1, but read operations will return
            encrypted data contents. This prevents attackers from inferring the TEE contents
            with direct reads.

            Additionally, with Secure Boot enabled (SECURE_BOOT_V2_ENABLED), any unauthorized
            modifications to the TEE firmware will be detected during boot, causing signature
            verification to fail. Thus, these options provide a level of protection suitable for
            most applications. However, while the TEE firmware integrity is protected, other TEE
            partitions (Secure Storage, TEE OTA data) can be manipulated through direct writes.

            Enable this option only when complete isolation of all TEE flash regions is required,
            even with the associated performance tradeoffs.

            Note: All accesses to the TEE partitions over SPI0 (i.e. the MMU) are blocked
            unconditionally.
