/**
 * Background
 *
 * This file is for the MSPI related, but not Flash driver related registers, these registers:
 * - may influence both Flash and PSRAM
 * - not related or directly related to Flash controller driver
 *
 * Some hints for naming convention:
 * - For MSPI timing tuning related registers, the LL should start with `mspi_timing_ll_`
 * - For others, the LL should start with `mspi_ll_`
