    help
        If this feature is enabled, all traffic from layer2(WIFI Driver) will be
        copied to a new buffer before sending it to layer3(LWIP stack), freeing
        the layer2 buffer.
        Please be notified that the total layer2 receiving buffer is fixed and 
        ESP32 currently supports 25 layer2 receiving buffer, when layer2 buffer 
        runs out of memory, then the incoming packets will be dropped in hardware. 
        The layer3 buffer is allocated from the heap, so the total layer3 receiving
        buffer depends on the available heap size, when heap runs out of memory,  
        no copy will be sent to layer3 and packet will be dropped in layer2. 
        Please make sure you fully understand the impact of this feature before 
        enabling it.

        Per-socket send buffer size can be changed at runtime

config TCP_RECVMBOX_SIZE
    int "Default TCP receive mail box size"
    default 6
    range 6 32
    help
        Set TCP receive mail box size. Generally bigger value means higher throughput
        but more memory. The recommended value is: TCP_WND_DEFAULT/TCP_MSS + 2, e.g. if 
        TCP_WND_DEFAULT=14360, TCP_MSS=1436, then the recommended receive mail box size is 
        (14360/1436 + 2) = 12.

        TCP receive mail box is a per socket mail box, when the application receives packets
        from TCP socket, LWIP core firstly posts the packets to TCP receive mail box and the 
        application then fetches the packets from mail box. It means LWIP can caches maximum 
        TCP_RECCVMBOX_SIZE packets for each TCP socket, so the maximum possible cached TCP packets
        for all TCP sockets is TCP_RECCVMBOX_SIZE multiples the maximum TCP socket number. In other
        words, the bigger TCP_RECVMBOX_SIZE means more memory.
        On the other hand, if the receiv mail box is too small, the mail box may be full. If the 
        mail box is full, the LWIP drops the packets. So generally we need to make sure the TCP
        receive mail box is big enough to avoid packet drop between LWIP core and application.

config TCP_QUEUE_OOSEQ

        of increased retransmissions if segments arrive out of order.

choice TCP_OVERSIZE

    help
        Allows enabling "oversize" allocation of TCP transmission pbufs ahead of time,
        which can reduce the length of pbuf chains used for transmission.

        This will not make a difference to sockets where Nagle's algorithm
        is disabled.

        Default value of MSS is fine for most applications, 25% MSS may save
        some RAM when only transmitting small amounts of data. Disabled will
        have worst performance and fragmentation characteristics, but uses
        least RAM overall.

    help
        Set UDP receive mail box size. The recommended value is 6.

        UDP receive mail box is a per socket mail box, when the application receives packets 
        from UDP socket, LWIP core firstly posts the packets to UDP receive mail box and the
        application then fetches the packets from mail box. It means LWIP can caches maximum
        UDP_RECCVMBOX_SIZE packets for each UDP socket, so the maximum possible cached UDP packets 
        for all UDP sockets is UDP_RECCVMBOX_SIZE multiples the maximum UDP socket number. In other
        words, the bigger UDP_RECVMBOX_SIZE means more memory.
        On the other hand, if the receiv mail box is too small, the mail box may be full. If the
        mail box is full, the LWIP drops the packets. So generally we need to make sure the UDP
