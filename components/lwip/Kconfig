            the layer2 buffer.
            Please be notified that the total layer2 receiving buffer is fixed and
            ESP32 currently supports 25 layer2 receiving buffer, when layer2 buffer
            runs out of memory, then the incoming packets will be dropped in hardware.
            The layer3 buffer is allocated from the heap, so the total layer3 receiving
            buffer depends on the available heap size, when heap runs out of memory,
            no copy will be sent to layer3 and packet will be dropped in layer2.

        help
            Enabling this option allows ARP table to be updated.

            If this option is enabled, the incoming IP packets cause the ARP table to be
            updated with the source MAC and IP addresses supplied in the packet.
            You may want to disable this if you do not trust LAN peers to have the
            correct addresses, or as a limited approach to attempt to handle
            spoofing. If disabled, lwIP will need to make a new ARP request if
            the peer is not already in the ARP table, adding a little latency.
            The peer *is* in the ARP table if it requested our address before.
            Also notice that this slows down input processing of every IP packet!

            There are two known issues in real application if this feature is enabled:
            - The LAN peer may have bug to update the ARP table after the ARP entry is aged out.
            If the ARP entry on the LAN peer is aged out but failed to be updated, all IP packets
            sent from LWIP to the LAN peer will be dropped by LAN peer.
            - The LAN peer may not be trustful, the LAN peer may send IP packets to LWIP with
            two different MACs, but the same IP address. If this happens, the LWIP has problem
            to receive IP packets from LAN peer.

            So the recommendation is to disable this option.
            Here the LAN peer means the other side to which the ESP station or soft-AP is connected.

                Set TCP receive mail box size. Generally bigger value means higher throughput
                but more memory. The recommended value is: LWIP_TCP_WND_DEFAULT/TCP_MSS + 2, e.g. if
                LWIP_TCP_WND_DEFAULT=14360, TCP_MSS=1436, then the recommended receive mail box size is
                (14360/1436 + 2) = 12.

                TCP receive mail box is a per socket mail box, when the application receives packets
                from TCP socket, LWIP core firstly posts the packets to TCP receive mail box and the
                application then fetches the packets from mail box. It means LWIP can caches maximum
                LWIP_TCP_RECCVMBOX_SIZE packets for each TCP socket, so the maximum possible cached TCP packets
                for all TCP sockets is LWIP_TCP_RECCVMBOX_SIZE multiples the maximum TCP socket number. In other
                words, the bigger LWIP_TCP_RECVMBOX_SIZE means more memory.
                On the other hand, if the receiv mail box is too small, the mail box may be full. If the
                mail box is full, the LWIP drops the packets. So generally we need to make sure the TCP
                receive mail box is big enough to avoid packet drop between LWIP core and application.

                Allows enabling "oversize" allocation of TCP transmission pbufs ahead of time,

                This will not make a difference to sockets where Nagle's algorithm
                is disabled.

                Default value of MSS is fine for most applications, 25% MSS may save
                some RAM when only transmitting small amounts of data. Disabled will
                have worst performance and fragmentation characteristics, but uses
