config L2_TO_L3_COPY
    bool "Enable copy between Layer2 and Layer3 packets"
    default n
    help
        If this feature is enabled, all traffic from layer2(WIFI Driver) will be
        copied to a new buffer before sending it to layer3(LWIP stack), freeing
        the layer2 buffer.
        Please be notified that the total layer2 receiving buffer is fixed and 
        ESP32 currently supports 25 layer2 receiving buffer, when layer2 buffer 
        runs out of memory, then the incoming packets will be dropped in hardware. 
        The layer3 buffer is allocated from the heap, so the total layer3 receiving
        buffer depends on the available heap size, when heap runs out of memory,  
        no copy will be sent to layer3 and packet will be dropped in layer2. 
        Please make sure you fully understand the impact of this feature before 
        enabling it.

        Sockets take up a certain amount of memory, and allowing fewer

        Enabling this option means that any incoming broadcast or multicast
        packet will be copied to all of the local sockets that it matches
        (may be more than one if SO_REUSEADDR is set on the socket.)

        This increases memory overhead as the packets need to be copied,
        however they are only copied per matching socket. You can safely
        disable it if you don't plan to receive broadcast or multicast
        traffic on more than one socket at a time.

        Enabling this option allows ARP table to be updated.

        If this option is enabled, the incoming IP packets cause the ARP table to be
        updated with the source MAC and IP addresses supplied in the packet.
        You may want to disable this if you do not trust LAN peers to have the
        correct addresses, or as a limited approach to attempt to handle
        spoofing. If disabled, lwIP will need to make a new ARP request if
        the peer is not already in the ARP table, adding a little latency.
        The peer *is* in the ARP table if it requested our address before.
        Also notice that this slows down input processing of every IP packet!

config TCP_RECVMBOX_SIZE

    help
        Set TCP receive mail box size. Generally bigger value means higher throughput
        but more memory. The recommended value is: TCP_WND_DEFAULT/TCP_MSS + 2, e.g. if 
        TCP_WND_DEFAULT=14360, TCP_MSS=1436, then the recommended receive mail box size is 
        (14360/1436 + 2) = 12.

        TCP receive mail box is a per socket mail box, when the application receives packets
        from TCP socket, LWIP core firstly posts the packets to TCP receive mail box and the 
        application then fetches the packets from mail box. It means LWIP can caches maximum 
        TCP_RECCVMBOX_SIZE packets for each TCP socket, so the maximum possible cached TCP packets
        for all TCP sockets is TCP_RECCVMBOX_SIZE multiples the maximum TCP socket number. In other
        words, the bigger TCP_RECVMBOX_SIZE means more memory.
        On the other hand, if the receiv mail box is too small, the mail box may be full. If the 
        mail box is full, the LWIP drops the packets. So generally we need to make sure the TCP
        receive mail box is big enough to avoid packet drop between LWIP core and application.

        Default value of MSS is fine for most applications, 25% MSS may save
        some RAM when only transmitting small amounts of data. Disabled will
        have worst performance and fragmentation characteristics, but uses
