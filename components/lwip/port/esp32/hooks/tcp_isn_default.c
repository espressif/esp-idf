 *
 * Reference implementation of the TCP ISN algorithm standardized in RFC 6528.
 * Produce TCP Initial Sequence Numbers by combining an MD5-generated hash
 * based on the new TCP connection's identity and a stable secret, with the
 * current time at 4-microsecond granularity.
 *
 * Specifically, the implementation uses MD5 to compute a hash of the input
 * buffer, which contains both the four-tuple of the new TCP connection (local
 * and remote IP address and port), as well as a 16-byte secret to make the
 * results unpredictable to external parties.  The secret must be given at
 * initialization time and should ideally remain the same across system
 * reboots.  To be sure: the spoofing-resistance of the resulting ISN depends
 * mainly on the strength of the supplied secret!
 *
 * The implementation takes 32 bits from the computed hash, and adds to it the
 * current time, in 4-microsecond units.  The current time is computed from a
 * boot time given at initialization, and the current uptime as provided by
 * sys_now().  Thus, it assumes that sys_now() returns a time value that is
 * relative to the boot time, i.e., that it starts at 0 at system boot, and
 * only ever increases monotonically.
 *
 * For efficiency reasons, a single MD5 input buffer is used, and partially
 * filled in at initialization time.  Specifically, of this 64-byte buffer, the
 * first 36 bytes are used for the four-way TCP tuple data, followed by the
 * 16-byte secret, followed by 12-byte zero padding.  The 64-byte size of the
 * buffer should achieve the best performance for the actual MD5 computation.
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * 1. in your lwipopts.h, add the following lines:
 *
 *    #include <lwip/arch.h>
 *    struct ip_addr;
 *    u32_t lwip_hook_tcp_isn(const struct ip_addr *local_ip, u16_t local_port,
 *      const struct ip_addr *remote_ip, u16_t remote_port);
 *   "#define LWIP_HOOK_TCP_ISN lwip_hook_tcp_isn";
 *
 * 2. from your own code, call lwip_init_tcp_isn() at initialization time, with
 *    appropriate parameters.
