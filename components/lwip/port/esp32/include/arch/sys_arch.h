/* Define the sys_mbox_set_invalid() to empty to support lock-free mbox in ESP LWIP.
 *
 * The basic idea about the lock-free mbox is that the mbox should always be valid unless
 * no socket APIs are using the socket and the socket is closed. ESP LWIP achieves this by
 * following two changes to official LWIP:
 * 1. Postpone the deallocation of mbox to netconn_free(), in other words, free the mbox when
 *    no one is using the socket.
 * 2. Define the sys_mbox_set_invalid() to empty if the mbox is not actually freed.

 * The second change is necessary. Consider a common scenario: the application task calls
 * recv() to receive packets from the socket, the sys_mbox_valid() returns true. Because there
 * is no lock for the mbox, the LWIP CORE can call sys_mbox_set_invalid() to set the mbox at
 * anytime and the thread-safe issue may happen.
 *
 * However, if the sys_mbox_set_invalid() is not called after sys_mbox_free(), e.g. in netconn_alloc(),
 * we need to initialize the mbox to invalid explicitly since sys_mbox_set_invalid() now is empty.
