            The value of 0 indicates the IP lost timer is disabled, otherwise the timer is enabled.

            The IP address may be lost because of some reasons, e.g. when the station disconnects
            from soft-AP, or when DHCP IP renew fails etc. If the IP lost timer is enabled, it will
            be started everytime the IP is lost. Event SYSTEM_EVENT_STA_LOST_IP will be raised if
            the timer expires. The IP lost timer is stopped if the station get the IP again before
            the timer expires.

            Enable if esp_netif_receive() should return error code. This is useful to inform upper layers
            that packet input to TCP/IP stack failed, so the upper layers could implement flow control.
            This option is disabled by default due to backward compatibility and will be enabled in v6.0 (IDF-7194)
