            This option allows to place .rtc_data and .rtc_rodata sections into
            RTC fast memory segment to free the slow memory region for ULP programs.
            This option depends on the CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE option because RTC fast memory
            can be accessed only by PRO_CPU core.

        bool "Use fixed static RAM size"
        default n
        help
            If this option is disabled, the DRAM part of the heap starts right after the .bss section,
            within the dram0_0 region. As a result, adding or removing some static variables
            will change the available heap size.

            If this option is enabled, the DRAM part of the heap starts right after the dram0_0 region,
            where its length is set with ESP32_FIXED_STATIC_RAM_SIZE

    config ESP32_FIXED_STATIC_RAM_SIZE
        hex "Fixed Static RAM size"

            RAM size dedicated for static variables (.data & .bss sections).
            Please note that the actual length will be reduced by BTDM_RESERVE_DRAM if Bluetooth
            controller is enabled.

    config ESP32_IRAM_AS_8BIT_ACCESSIBLE_MEMORY
        bool "Enable IRAM as 8 bit accessible memory"

        help
            If enabled, application can use IRAM as byte accessible region for storing data
            (Note: IRAM region cannot be used as task stack)

            This is possible due to handling of exceptions `LoadStoreError (3)` and `LoadStoreAlignmentError (9)`
            Each unaligned read/write access will incur a penalty of maximum of 167 CPU cycles.
