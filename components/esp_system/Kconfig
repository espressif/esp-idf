            To reduce the startup time of an external RTC crystal,
            we bootstrap it with a 32kHz square wave for a fixed number of cycles.
            Setting 0 will disable bootstrapping (if disabled, the crystal may take
            longer to start up or fail to oscillate under some conditions).

            If this value is too high, a faulty crystal may initially start and then fail.
            If this value is too low, an otherwise good crystal may not start.

            To accurately determine if the crystal has started,
            set a larger "Number of cycles for RTC_SLOW_CLK calibration" (about 3000).

            This config option allows to add RTC fast memory region to system heap with capability
            similar to that of DRAM region but without DMA. This memory will be consumed first per
            heap initialization order by early startup services and scheduler related code. Speed
            wise RTC fast memory operates on APB clock and hence does not have much performance impact.

            If enabled, chip will try to power down flash at light sleep, which costs more time when chip wakes up.
            Can only be enabled if there is no SPIRAM configured. This option will in fact consider VDD_SDIO auto power
            value (ESP_PD_OPTION_AUTO) as OFF. Also, it is possible to force a power domain to stay ON during light

                When software switches the CPU clock source from BBPLL clock to XTAL, usually the BBPLL will be
                switched off. This helps to save some power consumption in sleep modes. However this may also happen
                during the software reset, resulting in the inactive (disconnected from host) of the USB_SERIAL_JTAG
                device during software reset.

                When USB_SERIAL_JTAG is being used, whether to turn off the clock source during software reset and in
                sleep modes is determined by RTC_CLOCK_BBPLL_POWER_ON_WITH_USB.

                  - When RTC_CLOCK_BBPLL_POWER_ON_WITH_USB is enabled, the clock will be kept, so that the
                    USB_SERIAL_JTAG will keep alive during software reset. The side-effect is the increasing of power
                    consumption during sleep modes, even though USB_SERIAL_JTAG will not work in sleep modes.

                  - When RTC_CLOCK_BBPLL_POWER_ON_WITH_USB is disabled, the clock will be turned off. USB_SERIAL_JTAG
                    will be inactive during software reset and in sleep modes. This saves some power consumption in
                    sleep modes.

                When USB_SERIAL_JTAG is not being used, software will always turn off BBPLL regardless of
                RTC_CLOCK_BBPLL_POWER_ON_WITH_USB is set or not.
