            OpenThread can be configured to different device types (FTD, MTD, Radio)

        config OPENTHREAD_FTD
            bool "Full Thread Device"
            help
                Select this to enable Full Thread Device which can act as router and leader in a Thread network.

        config OPENTHREAD_MTD
            bool "Minimal Thread Device"
            help
                Select this to enable Minimal Thread Device which can only act as end device in a Thread network.
                This will reduce the code size of the OpenThread stack.

        config OPENTHREAD_RADIO
            bool "Radio Only Device"
            help
                Select this to enable Radio Only Device which cannot can only forward 15.4 packets to the host.
                The OpenThread stack will be run on the host and OpenThread will have minimal footprint on the
                radio only device.

    config OPENTHREAD_DIAG

        depends on OPENTHREAD_ENABLED
        default y
        help
            Select this option to enable Diag in OpenThread. This will enable diag mode and a series of diag commands
            in the OpenThread command line. These commands allow users to manipulate low-level features of the storage
            and 15.4 radio.

    config OPENTHREAD_COMMISSIONER

        depends on OPENTHREAD_ENABLED
        default n
        help
            Select this option to enable commissioner in OpenThread. This will enable the device to act as a
            commissioner in the Thread network. A commissioner checks the pre-shared key from a joining device with
            the Thread commissioning protocol and shares the network parameter with the joining device upon success.

    config OPENTHREAD_JOINER
        bool "Enable Joiner"
        depends on OPENTHREAD_ENABLED
        default n
        help
            Select this option to enable Joiner in OpenThread. This allows a device to join the Thread network with a
            pre-shared key using the Thread commissioning protocol.

    config OPENTHREAD_PARTITION_NAME
        string "The partition for OpenThread to store its network data"

            The storage size should be at least 8192 bytes.
