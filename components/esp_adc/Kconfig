            Place ISR version ADC oneshot mode read function into IRAM.

            Ensure the ADC continuous mode ISR is IRAM-Safe. When enabled, the ISR handler
            will be available when the cache is disabled.

            help
                Some ESP32s have Two Point calibration values burned into eFuse BLOCK3.
                This option will allow the ADC calibration component to characterize the
                ADC-Voltage curve using Two Point values if they are available.

            bool "Use eFuse Vref"
            default "y"
            help
                Some ESP32s have Vref burned into eFuse BLOCK0. This option will allow
                the ADC calibration component to characterize the ADC-Voltage curve using
                eFuse Vref if it is available.

        config ADC_CALI_LUT_ENABLE

            default "y"
            help
                This option will allow the ADC calibration component to use Lookup Tables
                to correct for non-linear behavior in 11db attenuation. Other attenuations
                do not exhibit non-linear behavior hence will not be affected by this option.

            By default, this is set. The ADC oneshot driver will disable the output of the
            corresponding DAC channels:
            ESP32:   IO25 and IO26
            ESP32S2: IO17 and IO18

            Disable this option so as to measure the output of DAC by internal ADC, for test usage.

            On ESP32C3 and ESP32S3, ADC2 Digital Controller is not stable. Therefore,
            ADC2 continuous mode is not suggested on ESP32S3 and ESP32C3

            If you stick to this, you can enable this option to force use ADC2 under above conditions.
