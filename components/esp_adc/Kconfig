                Some ESP32s have Two Point calibration values burned into eFuse BLOCK3.
                This option will allow the ADC calibration component to characterize the
                ADC-Voltage curve using Two Point values if they are available.

                Some ESP32s have Vref burned into eFuse BLOCK0. This option will allow
                the ADC calibration component to characterize the ADC-Voltage curve using

                This option will allow the ADC calibration component to use Lookup Tables
                to correct for non-linear behavior in 11db attenuation. Other attenuations
                do not exhibit non-linear behavior hence will not be affected by this option.

            By default, this is set. The ADC oneshot driver will disable the output of the
            corresponding DAC channels:
