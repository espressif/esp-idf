        is usually done by an added CR character. Enabling this will make the
        standard output code automatically add a CR character before a LF.

        formatting option. This option doesn't support 64-bit integer formats and C99
        features, such as positional arguments.

        For more details about "nano" formatting option, please see newlib readme file,
        search for '--enable-newlib-nano-formatted-io':
        https://sourceware.org/newlib/README

        If this option is enabled, build system will use functions available in
        ROM, reducing the application binary size. Functions available in ROM run
        faster than functions which run from flash. Functions available in ROM can
        also run when flash instruction cache is disabled.

        without any extra delay, this time is approximately 900us.
