            If the number of universal MAC addresses is four, all four interfaces (WiFi station, WiFi softap,
            Bluetooth and Ethernet) receive a universally administered MAC address. These are generated
            sequentially by adding 0, 1, 2 and 3 (respectively) to the final octet of the base MAC address.
            If the number of universal MAC addresses is two, only two interfaces (WiFi station and Bluetooth)
            receive a universally administered MAC address. These are generated sequentially by adding 0
            and 1 (respectively) to the base MAC address. The remaining two interfaces (WiFi softap and Ethernet)
            receive local MAC addresses. These are derived from the universal WiFi station and Bluetooth MAC
            addresses, respectively.
            When using the default (Espressif-assigned) base MAC address, either setting can be used. When using
            a custom universal MAC address range, the correct setting will depend on the allocation of MAC
            addresses in this range (either 2 or 4 per device.)

            To prevent interrupting DPORT workarounds,
            need to disable interrupt with a maximum used level in the system.

        bool "Enable IRAM as 8 bit accessible memory"
        depends on FREERTOS_UNICORE
        help
            If enabled, application can use IRAM as byte accessible region for storing data
            (Note: IRAM region cannot be used as task stack)

            This is possible due to handling of exceptions `LoadStoreError (3)` and `LoadStoreAlignmentError (9)`
            Each unaligned read/write access will incur a penalty of maximum of 167 CPU cycles.

    config ESP32_ALLOW_RTC_FAST_MEM_AS_HEAP
        bool "Enable RTC fast memory for dynamic allocations"
        default y
        depends on FREERTOS_UNICORE
        help
            This config option allows to add RTC fast memory region to system heap with capability
            similar to that of DRAM region but without DMA. This memory will be consumed first per
            heap initialization order by early startup services and scheduler related code. Speed
            wise RTC fast memory operates on APB clock and hence does not have much performance impact.
            RTC fast memory is accessible to PRO cpu only and hence this is allowed for single core
            configuration only for ESP32.

    config PM_ENABLE
        bool "Support for power management"
        default n
        help
            If enabled, application is compiled with support for power management.
            This option has run-time overhead (increased interrupt latency,
            longer time to enter idle state), and it also reduces accuracy of
            RTOS ticks and timers used for timekeeping.
            Enable this option if application uses power management APIs.

    config PM_DFS_INIT_AUTO
        bool "Enable dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) at startup"
        depends on PM_ENABLE
        default n
        help
            If enabled, startup code configures dynamic frequency scaling.
            Max CPU frequency is set to CONFIG_ESP32_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ setting,
            min frequency is set to XTAL frequency.
            If disabled, DFS will not be active until the application
            configures it using esp_pm_configure function.

    config PM_USE_RTC_TIMER_REF
        bool "Use RTC timer to prevent time drift (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        depends on PM_ENABLE && ESP_TIMER_IMPL_FRC2 && (ESP32_TIME_SYSCALL_USE_RTC || ESP32_TIME_SYSCALL_USE_RTC_FRC1)
        default n
        help
            When APB clock frequency changes, high-resolution timer (esp_timer)
            scale and base value need to be adjusted. Each adjustment may cause
            small error, and over time such small errors may cause time drift.
            If this option is enabled, RTC timer will be used as a reference to
            compensate for the drift.
            It is recommended that this option is only used if 32k XTAL is selected
            as RTC clock source.

    config PM_PROFILING
        bool "Enable profiling counters for PM locks"
        depends on PM_ENABLE
        default n
        help
            If enabled, esp_pm_* functions will keep track of the amount of time
            each of the power management locks has been held, and esp_pm_dump_locks
            function will print this information.
            This feature can be used to analyze which locks are preventing the chip
            from going into a lower power state, and see what time the chip spends
            in each power saving mode. This feature does incur some run-time
            overhead, so should typically be disabled in production builds.

    config PM_TRACE
        bool "Enable debug tracing of PM using GPIOs"
        depends on PM_ENABLE
        default n
        help
            If enabled, some GPIOs will be used to signal events such as RTOS ticks,
            frequency switching, entry/exit from idle state. Refer to pm_trace.c
            file for the list of GPIOs.
            This feature is intended to be used when analyzing/debugging behavior
            of power management implementation, and should be kept disabled in
            applications.
