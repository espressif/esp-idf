    help
        When the startup code initializes RTC_SLOW_CLK, it can perform
        calibration by comparing the RTC_SLOW_CLK frequency with main XTAL
        frequency. This option sets the number of RTC_SLOW_CLK cycles measured
        by the calibration routine. Higher numbers increase calibration
        precision, which may be important for applications which spend a lot of
        time in deep sleep. Lower numbers reduce startup time.
        
        When this option is set to 0, clock calibration will not be performed at
        startup, and approximate clock frequencies will be assumed:

        - 150000 Hz if internal RC oscillator is used as clock source
        - 32768 Hz if the 32k crystal oscillator is used

config ESP32_DEEP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_DELAY

    help
        When ESP32 exits deep sleep, the CPU and the flash chip are powered on
        at the same time. CPU will run deep sleep stub first, and then
        proceed to load code from flash. Some flash chips need sufficient
        time to pass between power on and first read operation. By default,
        without any extra delay, this time is approximately 900us, although
        some flash chip types need more than that.
        
        By default extra delay is set to 2000us. When optimizing startup time
        for applications which require it, this value may be reduced. 

        If you are seeing "flash read err, 1000" message printed to the
        console after deep sleep reset, try increasing this value.

        ESP32 currently supports the following XTAL frequencies:

        Startup code can automatically estimate XTAL frequency. This feature
        uses the internal 8MHz oscillator as a reference. Because the internal
        oscillator frequency is temperature dependent, it is not recommended
        to use automatic XTAL frequency detection in applications which need
        to work at high ambient temperatures and use high-temperature
        qualified chips and modules.

        The static rx buffers are allocated when esp_wifi_init is called, they are not freed

        For each received packet in static rx buffers, WiFi driver makes a copy

        is freed when the application, such as socket, successfully received the packet.
        For some applications, the WiFi driver receiving speed is faster than application 
        consuming speed, we may run out of memory if no limitation for the dynamic rx buffer
