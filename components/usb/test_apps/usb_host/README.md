# USB: Host test application

There are two sets of tests in this application:
1. Low-speed: Expects low-speed USB mouse with interrupt endpoint to be connected
2. Full-speed: Expects full-speed USB flash disk with 2 bulk endpoints to be connected

For running these tests locally, you will have to update device definitions (VID, PID, ...) in [test_usb_mock_msc.h](../common/test_usb_mock_msc.h) and [test_usb_mock_hid.h](../common/test_usb_mock_hid.h).
