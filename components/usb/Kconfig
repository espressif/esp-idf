            Each USB device attached is allocated a dedicated buffer for its OUT/IN transfers to/from the device's
            control endpoint. The maximum size of that buffer is determined by this option. The limited size of the
            transfer buffer have the following implications:
            - The maximum length of control transfers is limited
            - Device's with configuration descriptors larger than this limit cannot be supported

        help
            The underlying hardware has size adjustable FIFOs to cache USB packets on reception (IN) or for
            transmission (OUT). The size of these FIFOs will affect the largest MPS (maximum packet size) and the
            maximum number of packets that can be cached at any one time. The hardware contains the following
            FIFOS: RX (for all IN packets), Non-periodic TX (for Bulk and Control OUT packets), and Periodic TX
            (for Interrupt and Isochronous OUT packets). This configuration option allows biasing the FIFO sizes
            towards a particular use case, which may be necessary for devices that have endpoints with large MPS.
            The MPS limits for each biasing are listed below:

            Balanced:
            - IN (all transfer types), 408 bytes
            - OUT non-periodic (Bulk/Control), 192 bytes (i.e., 3 x 64 byte packets)
            - OUT periodic (Interrupt/Isochronous), 192 bytes

            Bias IN:
            - IN (all transfer types), 600 bytes
            - OUT non-periodic (Bulk/Control), 64 bytes (i.e., 1 x 64 byte packets)
            - OUT periodic (Interrupt/Isochronous), 128 bytes

            Bias Periodic OUT:
            - IN (all transfer types), 128 bytes
            - OUT non-periodic (Bulk/Control), 64 bytes (i.e., 1 x 64 byte packets)

                On connection of a USB device, the USB 2.0 specification requires a "debounce interval with a minimum
                duration of 100ms" to allow the connection to stabilize (see USB 2.0 chapter 7.1.7.3 for more details).
                During the debounce interval, no new connection/disconnection events are registered.

                The reset signaling can be generated on any Hub or Host Controller port by request from the USB System

                10ms" (see USB 2.0 chapter 7.1.7.5 for more details).  After the reset, the hub port will transition to
                the Enabled state (refer to Section 11.5).

                respond to data transfers (see USB 2.0 chapter 7.1.7.3 for more details). The device may ignore any
                data transfers during the recovery interval.
