                Ensure the LCD interrupt is IRAM-Safe by allowing the interrupt handler to be
                executable when the cache is disabled (e.g. SPI Flash write).
                If you want the LCD driver to keep flushing the screen even when cache ops disabled,
                you can enable this option. Note, this will also increase the IRAM usage.

                as fast as the LCD consumes it.
