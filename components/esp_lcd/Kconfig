                The peripheral clock is where LCD bus clock derives from.
                Each clock source has its unique feature, e.g.
                1. XTAL clock can help LCD work stable when DFS is enabled
                2. PLL160M can achieve higher pixel clock resolution

            help
                LCD driver allocates an internal buffer to transform the data into a proper format, because of
                the endian order mismatch. This option is to set the size of the buffer, in bytes.
