                LCD driver allocates an internal buffer to transform the data into a proper format, because of
                the endian order mismatch. This option is to set the size of the buffer, in bytes.

                Wether to enable the debug log message for LCD driver.
                Note that, this option only controls the LCD driver log, won't affect other drivers.

                    Ensure the LCD interrupt is IRAM-Safe by allowing the interrupt handler to be
                    executable when the cache is disabled (e.g. SPI Flash write).
                    If you want the LCD driver to keep flushing the screen even when cache ops disabled,
                    you can enable this option. Note, this will also increase the IRAM usage.
