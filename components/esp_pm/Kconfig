        help
            If enabled, application is compiled with support for power management.
            This option has run-time overhead (increased interrupt latency,
            longer time to enter idle state), and it also reduces accuracy of
            RTOS ticks and timers used for timekeeping.
            Enable this option if application uses power management APIs.

    config PM_DFS_INIT_AUTO
        bool "Enable dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) at startup"
        depends on PM_ENABLE
        default n
        help
            If enabled, startup code configures dynamic frequency scaling.
            Max CPU frequency is set to DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ setting,
            min frequency is set to XTAL frequency.
            If disabled, DFS will not be active until the application
            configures it using esp_pm_configure function.

    config PM_PROFILING
        bool "Enable profiling counters for PM locks"
        depends on PM_ENABLE
        default n
        help
            If enabled, esp_pm_* functions will keep track of the amount of time
            each of the power management locks has been held, and esp_pm_dump_locks
            function will print this information.
            This feature can be used to analyze which locks are preventing the chip
            from going into a lower power state, and see what time the chip spends
            in each power saving mode. This feature does incur some run-time
            overhead, so should typically be disabled in production builds.

    config PM_TRACE
        bool "Enable debug tracing of PM using GPIOs"
        depends on PM_ENABLE
        default n
        help
            If enabled, some GPIOs will be used to signal events such as RTOS ticks,
            frequency switching, entry/exit from idle state. Refer to pm_trace.c
            file for the list of GPIOs.
            This feature is intended to be used when analyzing/debugging behavior
            of power management implementation, and should be kept disabled in
            applications.

    config PM_SLP_IRAM_OPT
        bool "Put lightsleep related codes in internal RAM"
        depends on FREERTOS_USE_TICKLESS_IDLE
        help
            If enabled, about 2.1KB of lightsleep related source code would be in IRAM and chip would sleep
            longer for 310us at 160MHz CPU frequency most each time.
            This feature is intended to be used when lower power consumption is needed
            while there is enough place in IRAM to place source code.

    config PM_RTOS_IDLE_OPT
        bool "Put RTOS IDLE related codes in internal RAM"
        depends on FREERTOS_USE_TICKLESS_IDLE
        help
            If enabled, about 180Bytes of RTOS_IDLE related source code would be in IRAM and chip would sleep
            longer for 20us at 160MHz CPU frequency most each time.
            This feature is intended to be used when lower power consumption is needed
            while there is enough place in IRAM to place source code.

    config PM_SLP_DISABLE_GPIO
        bool "Disable all GPIO when chip at sleep"
        depends on FREERTOS_USE_TICKLESS_IDLE
        help
            This feature is intended to disable all GPIO pins at automantic sleep to get a lower power mode.
            If enabled, chips will disable all GPIO pins at automantic sleep to reduce about 200~300 uA current.
            If you want to specifically use some pins normally as chip wakes when chip sleeps,
            you can call 'gpio_sleep_sel_dis' to disable this feature on those pins.
            You can also keep this feature on and call 'gpio_sleep_set_direction' and 'gpio_sleep_set_pull_mode'
            to have a different GPIO configuration at sleep.
            Waring: If you want to enable this option on ESP32, you should enable `GPIO_ESP32_SUPPORT_SWITCH_SLP_PULL`
            at first, otherwise you will not be able to switch pullup/pulldown mode.

        help
            This option is invisible to users, and it is only used for ci testing,
            enabling it in the application will increase the sleep and wake-up time overhead

    config PM_LIGHTSLEEP_RTC_OSC_CAL_INTERVAL

        help
            The value of this option determines the calibration interval of the RTC_FAST/SLOW clock during sleep when
            power management is enabled. When it is configured as N, the RTC_FAST/SLOW clock will be calibrated
            every N times of lightsleep.
            Decreasing this value will increase the time the chip is in the active state, thereby increasing the
            average power consumption of the chip.
            Increasing this value can reduce the average power consumption, but when the external environment changes
            drastically and the chip RTC_FAST/SLOW oscillator frequency drifts, it may cause system instability.

            If enabled, the CPU will be powered down in light sleep, ESP chips supports saving and restoring CPU's running
            context before and after light sleep, the feature provides applications with seamless CPU powerdowned lightsleep
            without user awareness.
            But this will takes up some internal memory. On esp32c3 soc, enabling this option will consume 1.68 KB of internal
            RAM and will reduce sleep current consumption by about 100 uA. On esp32s3 soc, enabling this option will consume
            8.58 KB of internal RAM and will reduce sleep current consumption by about 650 uA.

    config PM_RESTORE_CACHE_TAGMEM_AFTER_LIGHT_SLEEP

        help
            Cache tag memory and CPU both belong to the CPU power domain. ESP chips supports saving and restoring Cache tag memory
            before and after sleep, this feature supports accesses to the external memory that was cached before sleep still
            be cached when the CPU wakes up from a powerdowned CPU lightsleep. This option controls the restore method for Cache
            tag memory in lightsleep.
            If this option is enabled, the I/D-cache tag memory will be backuped to the internal RAM before sleep and restored
            upon wakeup. Depending on the the cache configuration, if this option is enabled, it will consume up to 9 KB
            of internal RAM.
            If this option is disabled, all cached data won't be kept after sleep, the DCache will be writeback before
            sleep and invalid all cached data after sleep, all accesses to external memory(Flash/PSRAM) will be cache
            missed after waking up, resulting in performance degradation due to increased memory accesses latency.

    config PM_POWER_DOWN_PERIPHERAL_IN_LIGHT_SLEEP

        help
            If enabled, digital peripherals will be powered down in light sleep, it will reduce sleep
            current consumption by about 100 uA. Chip will save/restore register context at sleep/wake
            time to keep the system running. Enabling this option will increase static RAM and heap usage,
            the actual cost depends on the peripherals you have initialized. In order to save/restore the
            context of the necessary hardware for FreeRTOS to run, it will need at least 4.55 KB free heap
            at sleep time. Otherwise sleep will not power down the peripherals.

            Note1: Please use this option with caution, the current IDF does not support the retention of
            all peripherals. When the digital peripherals are powered off and a sleep and wake-up is completed,
            the peripherals that have not saved the running context are equivalent to performing a reset.
            !!! Please confirm the peripherals used in your application and their sleep retention support status
            before enabling this option, peripherals sleep retention driver support status is tracked in
            power_management.rst

            Note2: When this option is enabled simultaneously with FREERTOS_USE_TICKLESS_IDLE, since the UART will
            be powered down, the uart FIFO will be flushed before sleep to avoid data loss, however, this has the
            potential to block the sleep process and cause the wakeup time to be skipped, which will cause the tick
            of freertos to not be compensated correctly when returning from sleep and cause the system to crash.
            To avoid this, you can increase FREERTOS_IDLE_TIME_BEFORE_SLEEP threshold in menuconfig.

            If enabled, it allows user to register entry and exit callbacks which are called before and after
            entering auto light sleep.

            NOTE: These callbacks are executed from the IDLE task context hence you cannot have any blocking calls
            in your callbacks.

            NOTE: Enabling these callbacks may change sleep duration calculations based on time spent in callback and
            hence it is highly recommended to keep them as short as possible
