            If enabled, the chip will constantly monitor the connection status of the USB Serial/JTAG port. As long
            as the USB Serial/JTAG is connected, a ESP_PM_NO_LIGHT_SLEEP power management lock will be acquired to
            prevent the system from entering light sleep.
            This option can be useful if serial monitoring is needed via USB Serial/JTAG while power management is
            enabled, as the USB Serial/JTAG cannot work under light sleep and after waking up from light sleep.
            Note. This option can only control the automatic Light-Sleep behavior. If esp_light_sleep_start() is
            called manually from the program, enabling this option will not prevent light sleep entry even if the
            USB Serial/JTAG is in use.
