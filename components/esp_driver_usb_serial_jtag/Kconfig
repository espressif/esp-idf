            The USB-Serial-JTAG module on ESP chips is turned on by default after power-on.
            If your application does not need it and not rely on it to be used as system
            console or use the built-in JTAG for debugging, you can disable this option,
            then the clock of this module will be disabled at startup, which will save
            some power consumption.

        help
            If enabled, the chip will constantly monitor the connection status of the USB Serial/JTAG port. As long
            as the USB Serial/JTAG is connected, a ESP_PM_NO_LIGHT_SLEEP power management lock will be acquired to
            prevent the system from entering light sleep.
            This option can be useful if serial monitoring is needed via USB Serial/JTAG while power management is
            enabled, as the USB Serial/JTAG cannot work under light sleep and after waking up from light sleep.
            Note. This option can only control the automatic Light-Sleep behavior. If esp_light_sleep_start() is
            called manually from the program, enabling this option will not prevent light sleep entry even if the
            USB Serial/JTAG is in use.
