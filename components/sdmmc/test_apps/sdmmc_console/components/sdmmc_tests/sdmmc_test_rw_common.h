 * @brief Test read/write performance of the card
 *
 * This function writes a buffer to the card, then reads it back.
 * The time taken for each operation is measured, and the throughput is calculated.
 * The process is repeated for different buffer sizes and card offsets.
 * In this test, data is always written and read at the beginning of the card.
 *
 * This test function works both with SDMMC and SDSPI hosts.
 *
 * @param card Pointer to the card object, must be initialized before calling this function.
 * @param perf_log If not null, additional "performance log" lines are written to this file.
 *                 These lines are in a format recognized by pytest-embedded.
