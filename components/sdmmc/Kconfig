            The maximum size in blocks of the chunks a SDMMC read/write with an unaligned buffer will be split into.
            The SDMMC driver requires aligned buffers for DMA access. If unaligned buffers are passed and the host's
            dma_aligned_buffer is NULL, an aligned temporary buffer must be allocated for the actual transfer.
            This option defines the maximum size for the temporary buffer, which equals this option's value multiplied
            with the block size (typically 512 Bytes). A value of 16 therefore leads to up to 8192 bytes being
            allocated on the heap for each transfer. The allocated buffer will never be larger than the number of bytes
            to transfer in total.
            It also decides whether single (value == 1) or multi block read/write (value > 1) commands are used.
            With the default value of 1 single-block read/write commands will be used with the allocated buffer size
            matching the block size.
            You should keep this option at 1 if your card or configuration doesn't support the read or write multiple
            blocks commands (CMD18 & CMD25).
