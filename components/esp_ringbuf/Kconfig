            Place ring buffer functions in IRAM for better performance.
            By default, ring buffer functions are placed in Flash to save IRAM.
            Enable this option if you need maximum performance for ring buffer operations.

            Note: This option increases IRAM usage.

    config RINGBUF_PLACE_ISR_FUNCTIONS_INTO_FLASH
        bool "Place ISR ringbuf functions into flash"
        depends on !RINGBUF_IN_IRAM
        default n
        help
            Place ISR ringbuf functions (like xRingbufferSendFromISR/xRingbufferReceiveFromISR) into flash.
            This frees up IRAM, but the functions can no longer be called when the cache is disabled
            or from an IRAM interrupt context.

            This option is not compatible with ESP-IDF drivers which are configured to
            run the ISR from an IRAM context, e.g. CONFIG_UART_ISR_IN_IRAM.
