            Place non-ISR ringbuf functions (like xRingbufferCreate/xRingbufferSend) into flash.
            This frees up IRAM, but the functions can no longer be called when the cache is disabled.


    config RINGBUF_PLACE_ISR_FUNCTIONS_INTO_FLASH
        bool "Place ISR ringbuf functions into flash"
        default n
        help
            Place non-ISR ringbuf functions (like xRingbufferSendFromISR/xRingbufferReceiveFromISR) into flash.
            This frees up IRAM, but the functions can no longer be called when the cache is disabled
            or from an IRAM interrupt context.

            This option is not compatible with ESP-IDF drivers which is configured to run the ISR from an IRAM context,
            e.g. CONFIG_UART_ISR_IN_IRAM.
