        bool "Place DAC control functions into IRAM"

        help
            Place DAC control functions (e.g. 'dac_oneshot_output_voltage') into IRAM,
            so that this function can be IRAM-safe and able to be called in the other IRAM interrupt context.
            Enabling this option can improve driver performance as well.

    config DAC_ISR_IRAM_SAFE
        bool "DAC ISR IRAM-Safe"
        default n
        help
            Ensure the DAC interrupt is IRAM-Safe by allowing the interrupt handler to be
            executable when the cache is disabled (e.g. SPI Flash write).

    config DAC_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATE_WARN
        bool "Suppress legacy driver deprecated warning"
        default n
        help
            Wether to suppress the deprecation warnings when using legacy DAC driver (driver/dac.h).
            If you want to continue using the legacy driver, and don't want to see related deprecation warnings,
            you can enable this option.

    config DAC_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG
        bool "Enable debug log"
        default n
        help
            Wether to enable the debug log message for DAC driver.
            Note that, this option only controls the DAC driver log, won't affect other drivers.

    config DAC_DMA_AUTO_16BIT_ALIGN
        bool "Align the continuous data to 16 bit automatically"
        depends on SOC_DAC_DMA_16BIT_ALIGN
        default y
        help
            Whether to left shift the continuous data to align every bytes to 16 bits in the driver.
            On ESP32, although the DAC resolution is only 8 bits,
            the hardware requires 16 bits data in continuous mode.
            By enabling this option, the driver will left shift 8 bits for the input data automatically.
            Only disable this option when you decide to do this step by yourself.
            Note that the driver will allocate a new piece of memory to save the converted data.
