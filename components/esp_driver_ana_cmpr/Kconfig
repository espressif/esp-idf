        help
            Ensure the Analog Comparator interrupt is IRAM-Safe by allowing the interrupt handler to be
            executable when the cache is disabled (e.g. SPI Flash write).

    config ANA_CMPR_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM
        bool "Place Analog Comparator control functions into IRAM"
        default n
        help
            Place Analog Comparator control functions (like ana_cmpr_set_internal_reference) into IRAM,
            so that these functions can be IRAM-safe and able to be called in an IRAM interrupt context.
            Enabling this option can improve driver performance as well.

    config ANA_CMPR_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG
        bool "Enable debug log"
        default n
        help
            whether to enable the debug log message for Analog Comparator driver.
            Note that, this option only controls the Analog Comparator driver log, won't affect other drivers.
