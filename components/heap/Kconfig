        Enable heap poisoning features to detect heap corruption caused by out-of-bounds access to heap memory.

        See the "Heap Memory Debugging" page of the IDF documentation
        for a description of each level of heap corruption detection.

config HEAP_TRACING
    bool "Enable heap tracing"
    help
        Enables the heap tracing API defined in esp_heap_trace.h.

        This function causes a moderate increase in IRAM code side and a minor increase in heap function
        (malloc/free/realloc) CPU overhead, even when the tracing feature is not used. So it's best to keep it disabled
        unless tracing is being used.

config HEAP_TRACING_STACK_DEPTH
    int "Heap tracing stack depth"
    range 0 10
    default 2
    depends on HEAP_TRACING
    help
        Number of stack frames to save when tracing heap operation callers.

        More stack frames uses more memory in the heap trace buffer (and slows down allocation), but
        can provide useful information.
