            Enable heap poisoning features to detect heap corruption caused by out-of-bounds access to heap memory.

            See the "Heap Memory Debugging" page of the IDF documentation
            for a description of each level of heap corruption detection.

        help
            Enables the heap tracing API defined in esp_heap_trace.h.

            This function causes a moderate increase in IRAM code side and a minor increase in heap function
            (malloc/free/realloc) CPU overhead, even when the tracing feature is not used.
            So it's best to keep it disabled unless tracing is being used.

            Enables/disables heap tracing API.

        help
            Number of stack frames to save when tracing heap operation callers.

            More stack frames uses more memory in the heap trace buffer (and slows down allocation), but
            can provide useful information.

    config HEAP_USE_HOOKS
        bool "Use allocation and free hooks"
        help
            Enable the user to implement function hooks triggered for each successful allocation and free.

    config HEAP_TASK_TRACKING
        bool "Enable heap task tracking"
        help
            Enables tracking the task responsible for each heap allocation.

            This function depends on heap poisoning being enabled and adds four more bytes of overhead for each block
            allocated.

    config HEAP_TRACE_HASH_MAP
        bool "Use hash map mechanism to access heap trace records"
        depends on HEAP_TRACING_STANDALONE
        default n
        help
            Enable this flag to use a hash map to increase performance in handling
            heap trace records.

            Heap trace standalone supports storing records as a list, or a list + hash map.

            Using only a list takes less memory, but calls to 'free' will get slower as the
            list grows. This is particularly affected when using HEAP_TRACE_ALL mode.

            By using a list + hash map, calls to 'free' remain fast, at the cost of
            additional memory to store the hash map.

    config HEAP_TRACE_HASH_MAP_IN_EXT_RAM
        bool "Place hash map in external RAM"
        depends on HEAP_TRACE_HASH_MAP
        default n
        help
            When enabled this configuration forces the hash map to be placed in external RAM.

    config HEAP_TRACE_HASH_MAP_SIZE
        int "The number of entries in the hash map"
        depends on HEAP_TRACE_HASH_MAP
        default 512
        help
            Defines the number of entries in the heap trace hashmap. Each entry takes 8 bytes.
            The bigger this number is, the better the performance. Recommended range: 200 - 2000.

    config HEAP_ABORT_WHEN_ALLOCATION_FAILS
        bool "Abort if memory allocation fails"
        default n
        help
            When enabled, if a memory allocation operation fails it will cause a system abort.

    config HEAP_TLSF_USE_ROM_IMPL
        bool "Use ROM implementation of heap tlsf library"
        depends on ESP_ROM_HAS_HEAP_TLSF
        default y
        help
            Enable this flag to use heap functions from ROM instead of ESP-IDF.

            If keeping this as "n" in your project, you will have less free IRAM.
            If making this as "y" in your project, you will increase free IRAM,
            but you will lose the possibility to debug this module, and some new
            features will be added and bugs will be fixed in the IDF source
            but cannot be synced to ROM.

    config HEAP_PLACE_FUNCTION_INTO_FLASH
        bool "Force the entire heap component to be placed in flash memory"
        depends on !HEAP_TLSF_USE_ROM_IMPL
        default n
        help
            Enable this flag to save up RAM space by placing the heap component in the flash memory

            Note that it is only safe to enable this configuration if no functions from esp_heap_caps.h
            or esp_heap_trace.h are called from ISR.
