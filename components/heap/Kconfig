            Enable heap poisoning features to detect heap corruption caused by out-of-bounds access to heap memory.

            See the "Heap Memory Debugging" page of the IDF documentation
            for a description of each level of heap corruption detection.

        help
            Enables the heap tracing API defined in esp_heap_trace.h.

            This function causes a moderate increase in IRAM code side and a minor increase in heap function
            (malloc/free/realloc) CPU overhead, even when the tracing feature is not used.
            So it's best to keep it disabled unless tracing is being used.

            Enables/disables heap tracing API.

        help
            Number of stack frames to save when tracing heap operation callers.

            More stack frames uses more memory in the heap trace buffer (and slows down allocation), but
            can provide useful information.

    config HEAP_TASK_TRACKING
        bool "Enable heap task tracking"
        depends on !HEAP_POISONING_DISABLED
        help
            Enables tracking the task responsible for each heap allocation.

            This function depends on heap poisoning being enabled and adds four more bytes of overhead for each block
            allocated.

    config HEAP_ABORT_WHEN_ALLOCATION_FAILS
        bool "Abort if memory allocation fails"
        default n
        help
            When enabled, if a memory allocation operation fails it will cause a system abort.

        bool "Use ROM implementation of heap tlsf library"

        default y
        help
            Enable this flag to use heap functions from ROM instead of ESP-IDF.

            If keeping this as "n" in your project, you will have less free IRAM.
            If making this as "y" in your project, you will increase free IRAM,
            but you will lose the possibility to debug this module, and some new
            features will be added and bugs will be fixed in the IDF source
            but cannot be synced to ROM.
