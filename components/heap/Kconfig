            Enable heap poisoning features to detect heap corruption caused by out-of-bounds access to heap memory.

            See the "Heap Memory Debugging" page of the IDF documentation
            for a description of each level of heap corruption detection.

        help
            Enables the heap tracing API defined in esp_heap_trace.h.

            This function causes a moderate increase in IRAM code side and a minor increase in heap function
            (malloc/free/realloc) CPU overhead, even when the tracing feature is not used.
            So it's best to keep it disabled unless tracing is being used.

        config HEAP_TRACING_OFF
            bool "Disabled"

            Enables/disables heap tracing API.

    config HEAP_TRACING_STACK_DEPTH
        int "Heap tracing stack depth"
        range 0 10

        depends on HEAP_TRACING
        help
            Number of stack frames to save when tracing heap operation callers.

            More stack frames uses more memory in the heap trace buffer (and slows down allocation), but
            can provide useful information.

    config HEAP_TASK_TRACKING
        bool "Enable heap task tracking"
        depends on !HEAP_POISONING_DISABLED
        help
            Enables tracking the task responsible for each heap allocation.

            This function depends on heap poisoning being enabled and adds four more bytes of overhead for each block
            allocated.
