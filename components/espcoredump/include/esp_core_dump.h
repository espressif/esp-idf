 * @brief  Saves core dump to flash.

 * The structure of data stored in flash is as follows:
 *
 * |  TOTAL_LEN |  VERSION    | TASKS_NUM   | TCB_SIZE |
 * | TCB_ADDR_1 | STACK_TOP_1 | STACK_END_1 | TCB_1    | STACK_1 |

 * | TCB_ADDR_N | STACK_TOP_N | STACK_END_N | TCB_N    | STACK_N |
 * |  CHECKSUM  |
 *
 * Core dump in flash consists of header and data for every task in the system at the moment of crash.
 * For flash data integrity, a checksum is used at the end of core the dump data.
 * The structure of core dump data is described below in details.
 * 1) Core dump starts with header:
 * 1.1) TOTAL_LEN is total length of core dump data in flash including the checksum. Size is 4 bytes.
 * 1.2) VERSION field keeps 4 byte version of core dump.
 * 1.2) TASKS_NUM is the number of tasks for which data are stored. Size is 4 bytes.
 * 1.3) TCB_SIZE is the size of task's TCB structure. Size is 4 bytes.
 * 2) Core dump header is followed by the data for every task in the system.
 *    Task data are started with task header:
 * 2.1) TCB_ADDR is the address of TCB in memory. Size is 4 bytes.
 * 2.2) STACK_TOP is the top of task's stack (address of the topmost stack item). Size is 4 bytes.
 * 2.2) STACK_END is the end of task's stack (address from which task's stack starts). Size is 4 bytes.
 * 3) Task header is followed by TCB data. Size is TCB_SIZE bytes.
 * 4) Task's stack is placed after TCB data. Size is (STACK_END - STACK_TOP) bytes.
 * 5) The checksum is placed at the end of the data.

 * @brief  Print base64-encoded core dump to UART.
 *
 * The structure of core dump data is the same as for data stored in flash (@see esp_core_dump_to_flash) with some notes:
 * 1) The checksum is not present in core dump printed to UART.
 * 2) Since checksum is omitted TOTAL_LEN does not include its size.
 * 3) Printed base64 data are surrounded with special messages to help user recognize the start and end of actual data.
