            Exposes an additional callback whereby firmware data could be decrypted
            before being processed by OTA update component. This can help to integrate
            external encryption related format and removal of such encapsulation layer
            from firmware image.

        bool "Allow HTTP for OTA (WARNING: ONLY FOR TESTING PURPOSE, READ HELP)"

            It is highly recommended to keep HTTPS (along with server certificate validation) enabled.
            Enabling this option comes with potential risk of:
            - Non-encrypted communication channel with server
            - Accepting firmware upgrade image from server with fake identity
