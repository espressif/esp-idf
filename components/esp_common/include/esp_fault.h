/**
 * @brief Assert a condition is true, in a way that should be resistant to fault injection for
 * single fault attacks.
 *
 * - Expands CONDITION multiple times (condition must have no side effects)
 * - Compiler is told all registers are invalid before evaluating CONDITION each time, to avoid a fault
 *   causing a misread of a register used in all three evaluations of CONDITION.
 * - If CONDITION is ever false, a system reset is triggered.
 *
 * @note Place this macro after a "normal" check of CONDITION that will fail with a normal error
 * message. This is the fallback in case a fault injection attack skips or corrupts the result of
 * that check. (Although ensure that an attacker can't use fault injection to skip past the "normal"
 * error message, to avoid this check entirely.)
 *
 * @note This macro increases binary size and is slow and should be used sparingly.
 *
 * @note This macro does not guarantee fault injection resistance. In particular CONDITION must be
 * chosen carefully - a fault injection attack which sets CONDITION to true will not be detected by
 * this macro. Care must also be taken that an attacker can't use a fault to completely bypass calling
 * whatever function tests ESP_FAULT_ASSERT.
 *
 * @note This is difficult to debug as a failure triggers an instant software reset, and UART output
 * is often truncated (as FIFO is not flushed). Define the ESP_FAULT_ASSERT_DEBUG macro to debug any
 * failures of this macro due to software bugs.
 *
 * @param CONDITION A condition which will evaluate true unless an attacker used fault injection to skip or corrupt some other critical system calculation.
 *
