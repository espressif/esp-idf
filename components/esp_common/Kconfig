            Functions esp_err_to_name() and esp_err_to_name_r() return string representations of error codes from a
            pre-generated lookup table. This option can be used to turn off the use of the look-up table in order to
            save memory but this comes at the price of sacrificing distinguishable (meaningful) output string
            representations.
