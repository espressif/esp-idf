        The value of 0 indicates the IP lost timer is disabled, otherwise the timer is enabled.
        
        The IP address may be lost because of some reasons, e.g. when the station disconnects
        from soft-AP, or when DHCP IP renew fails etc. If the IP lost timer is enabled, it will 
        be started everytime the IP is lost. Event SYSTEM_EVENT_STA_LOST_IP will be raised if
        the timer expires. The IP lost timer is stopped if the station get the IP again before
        the timer expires.
