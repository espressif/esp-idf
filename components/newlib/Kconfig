        help
            This option allows configuring the desired line endings sent to UART
            when a newline ('\n', LF) appears on stdout.
            Three options are possible:

            CRLF: whenever LF is encountered, prepend it with CR

            LF: no modification is applied, stdout is sent as is

            CR: each occurence of LF is replaced with CR

            This option doesn't affect behavior of the UART driver (drivers/uart.h).

        config NEWLIB_STDOUT_LINE_ENDING_CRLF
            bool "CRLF"
        config NEWLIB_STDOUT_LINE_ENDING_LF
            bool "LF"

        help
            This option allows configuring which input sequence on UART produces
            a newline ('\n', LF) on stdin.
            Three options are possible:

            CRLF: CRLF is converted to LF

            LF: no modification is applied, input is sent to stdin as is

            CR: each occurence of CR is replaced with LF

            This option doesn't affect behavior of the UART driver (drivers/uart.h).

        config NEWLIB_STDIN_LINE_ENDING_CRLF
            bool "CRLF"
        config NEWLIB_STDIN_LINE_ENDING_LF
            bool "LF"

    config NEWLIB_NANO_FORMAT
        bool "Enable 'nano' formatting options for printf/scanf family"
        default y if IDF_TARGET_ESP32C2
        help
            ESP32 ROM contains parts of newlib C library, including printf/scanf family
            of functions. These functions have been compiled with so-called "nano"
            formatting option. This option doesn't support 64-bit integer formats and C99
            features, such as positional arguments.

            For more details about "nano" formatting option, please see newlib readme file,
            search for '--enable-newlib-nano-formatted-io':
            https://sourceware.org/newlib/README

            If this option is enabled, build system will use functions available in
            ROM, reducing the application binary size. Functions available in ROM run
            faster than functions which run from flash. Functions available in ROM can
            also run when flash instruction cache is disabled.

            If you need 64-bit integer formatting support or C99 features, keep this
            option disabled.

    choice NEWLIB_TIME_SYSCALL
        prompt "Timers used for gettimeofday function"
        default NEWLIB_TIME_SYSCALL_USE_RTC_HRT
        help
            This setting defines which hardware timers are used to
            implement 'gettimeofday' and 'time' functions in C library.

            - If both high-resolution (systimer for all targets except ESP32)
                and RTC timers are used, timekeeping will continue in deep sleep.
                Time will be reported at 1 microsecond resolution.
                This is the default, and the recommended option.
            - If only high-resolution timer (systimer) is used, gettimeofday will
                provide time at microsecond resolution.
                Time will not be preserved when going into deep sleep mode.
            - If only RTC timer is used, timekeeping will continue in
                deep sleep, but time will be measured at 6.(6) microsecond
                resolution. Also the gettimeofday function itself may take
                longer to run.
            - If no timers are used, gettimeofday and time functions
                return -1 and set errno to ENOSYS.
            - When RTC is used for timekeeping, two RTC_STORE registers are
                used to keep time in deep sleep mode.
