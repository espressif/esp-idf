cve-exclude-list:
  - cve: CVE-2024-30949
    reason: A vulnerability was discovered in the gettimeofday system call implementation within the RISC-V libgloss component of Newlib. ESP-IDF does not link against libgloss for RISC-V, hence the issue is not directly applicable. Still, the relevant fix has been patched through https://github.com/espressif/newlib-esp32/commit/047ba47013c2656a1e7838dc86cbc75aeeaa67a7
