/* Notes on our newlib lock implementation:
 *
 * - Use FreeRTOS mutex semaphores as locks.
 * - lock_t is int, but we store an xSemaphoreHandle there.
 * - Locks are no-ops until the FreeRTOS scheduler is running.
 * - Due to this, locks need to be lazily initialised the first time
 *   they are acquired. Initialisation/deinitialisation of locks is
 *   protected by lock_init_spinlock.
 * - Race conditions around lazy initialisation (via lock_acquire) are
 *   protected against.
 * - Anyone calling lock_close is reponsible for ensuring noone else
 *   is holding the lock at this time.
 * - Race conditions between lock_close & lock_init (for the same lock)
 *   are the responsibility of the caller.

           implements these as macros instead of inline functions
