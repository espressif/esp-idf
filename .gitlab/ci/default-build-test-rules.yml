# this file support two keywords:
# - extra_default_build_targets:
#     besides of the SUPPORTED_TARGETS in IDF,
#     enable build for the specified targets by default as well.
# !!! DEPRECATED: use `additional_build_targets` in .idf_build_apps.toml instead
#
# - bypass_check_test_targets:
#     suppress the check_build_test_rules check-test-script warnings for the specified targets
#
# This file should ONLY be used during bringup. Should be reset to empty after the bringup process

bypass_check_test_targets:
  - esp32h21
  - esp32h4
  - esp32c5

#
# These lines would
# - enable the README.md check for esp32c6. Don't forget to add the build jobs in .gitlab/ci/build.yml
# - disable the test script check with the manifest file.
