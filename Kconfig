            default APP_BUILD_TYPE_APP_2NDBOOT
            help
                Select the way the application is built.

                By default, the application is built as a binary file in a format compatible with
                the ESP-IDF bootloader. In addition to this application, 2nd stage bootloader is
                also built. Application and bootloader binaries can be written into flash and
                loaded/executed from there.

                Another option, useful for only very small and limited applications, is to only link
                the .elf file of the application, such that it can be loaded directly into RAM over
                JTAG or UART. Note that since IRAM and DRAM sizes are very limited, it is not possible
                to build any complex application this way. However for some kinds of testing and debugging,
                this option may provide faster iterations, since the application does not need to be
                written into flash.

                Note: when APP_BUILD_TYPE_RAM is selected and loaded with JTAG, ESP-IDF does not contain
                all the startup code required to initialize the CPUs and ROM memory (data/bss).
                Therefore it is necessary to execute a bit of ROM code prior to executing the application.
                A gdbinit file may look as follows (for ESP32):

                    # Connect to a running instance of OpenOCD
                    target remote :3333
                    # Reset and halt the target
                    mon reset halt
                    # Run to a specific point in ROM code,
                    #  where most of initialization is complete.
                    thb *0x40007d54
                    c
                    # Load the application into RAM
                    load
                    # Run till app_main
                    tb app_main
                    c

                Execute this gdbinit file as follows:

                    xtensa-esp32-elf-gdb build/app-name.elf -x gdbinit

                Example gdbinit files for other targets can be found in tools/test_apps/system/gdb_loadable_elf/

                When loading the BIN with UART, the ROM will jump to ram and run the app after finishing the ROM
                startup code, so there's no additional startup initialization required. You can use the
                `load_ram` in esptool.py to load the generated .bin file into ram and execute.

                Example:
                    esptool.py --chip {chip} -p {port} -b {baud} --no-stub load_ram {app.bin}

                Recommended sdkconfig.defaults for building loadable ELF files is as follows.
                CONFIG_APP_BUILD_TYPE_RAM is required, other options help reduce application

                Enabling this option compiles all C++ files with RTTI support enabled.
                This increases binary size (typically by tens of kB) but allows using
                dynamic_cast conversion and typeid operator.

        choice COMPILER_STACK_CHECK_MODE

            help
                Stack smashing protection mode. Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack
                smashing attacks. This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with vulnerable objects.
                The guards are initialized when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.
                If a guard check fails, program is halted. Protection has the following modes:

                - In NORMAL mode (GCC flag: -fstack-protector) only functions that call alloca, and functions with
                  buffers larger than 8 bytes are protected.

                - STRONG mode (GCC flag: -fstack-protector-strong) is like NORMAL, but includes additional functions
                  to be protected -- those that have local array definitions, or have references to local frame
                  addresses.

                - In OVERALL mode (GCC flag: -fstack-protector-all) all functions are protected.

                Modes have the following impact on code performance and coverage:

                - performance: NORMAL > STRONG > OVERALL

                - coverage: NORMAL < STRONG < OVERALL

                The performance impact includes increasing the amount of stack memory required for each task.

            help
                Adds -Wwrite-strings flag for the C/C++ compilers.

                For C, this gives string constants the type ``const char[]`` so that
                copying the address of one into a non-const ``char *`` pointer
                produces a warning. This warning helps to find at compile time code
                that tries to write into a string constant.

                For C++, this warns about the deprecated conversion from string
                literals to ``char *``.

        config COMPILER_SAVE_RESTORE_LIBCALLS
            bool "Enable -msave-restore flag to reduce code size"
            depends on IDF_TARGET_ARCH_RISCV
            help
                Adds -msave-restore to C/C++ compilation flags.

                When this flag is enabled, compiler will call library functions to
                save/restore registers in function prologues/epilogues. This results
                in lower overall code size, at the expense of slightly reduced performance.

                This option can be enabled for RISC-V targets only.

        config COMPILER_DUMP_RTL_FILES
            bool "Dump RTL files during compilation"
            help
                If enabled, RTL files will be produced during compilation. These files
                can be used by other tools, for example to calculate call graphs.
