                Enabling this option compiles all IDF C++ files with exception support enabled.

                Disabling this option disables C++ exception support in all compiled files, and any libstdc++ code
                which throws an exception will abort instead.

                Enabling this option currently adds an additional ~500 bytes of heap overhead

                Stack smashing protection mode. Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack
                smashing attacks. This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with vulnerable objects.
                The guards are initialized when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.
                If a guard check fails, program is halted. Protection has the following modes:

                - In NORMAL mode (GCC flag: -fstack-protector) only functions that call alloca, and functions with
                  buffers larger than 8 bytes are protected.

                - STRONG mode (GCC flag: -fstack-protector-strong) is like NORMAL, but includes additional functions
                  to be protected -- those that have local array definitions, or have references to local frame
                  addresses.

                - In OVERALL mode (GCC flag: -fstack-protector-all) all functions are protected.

                Modes have the following impact on code performance and coverage:

                - performance: NORMAL > STRONG > OVERALL

                - coverage: NORMAL < STRONG < OVERALL

                For C, this gives string constants the type ``const char[]`` so that
                copying the address of one into a non-const ``char *`` pointer
                produces a warning. This warning helps to find at compile time code
                that tries to write into a string constant.

                For C++, this warns about the deprecated conversion from string
                literals to ``char *``.

                included through long header chain everywhere.

                This is harmful to the modularity. So it's changed in IDF
                v4.0.

                You can still include these headers in a legacy way until it
                is totally deprecated by enable this option.
