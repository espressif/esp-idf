            help
                Select the way the application is built.

                By default, the application is built as a binary file in a format compatible with
                the ESP-IDF bootloader. In addition to this application, 2nd stage bootloader is
                also built. Application and bootloader binaries can be written into flash and
                loaded/executed from there.

                Another option, useful for only very small and limited applications, is to only link
                the .elf file of the application, such that it can be loaded directly into RAM over
                JTAG. Note that since IRAM and DRAM sizes are very limited, it is not possible to
                build any complex application this way. However for kinds of testing and debugging,
                this option may provide faster iterations, since the application does not need to be
                written into flash.
                Note that at the moment, ESP-IDF does not contain all the startup code required to
                initialize the CPUs and ROM memory (data/bss). Therefore it is necessary to execute
                a bit of ROM code prior to executing the application. A gdbinit file may look as follows (for ESP32):

                    # Connect to a running instance of OpenOCD
                    target remote :3333
                    # Reset and halt the target
                    mon reset halt
                    # Run to a specific point in ROM code,
                    #  where most of initialization is complete.
                    thb *0x40007d54
                    c
                    # Load the application into RAM
                    load
                    # Run till app_main
                    tb app_main
                    c

                Execute this gdbinit file as follows:

                    xtensa-esp32-elf-gdb build/app-name.elf -x gdbinit

                Example gdbinit files for other targets can be found in tools/test_apps/system/gdb_loadable_elf/

                Recommended sdkconfig.defaults for building loadable ELF files is as follows.

                Stack smashing protection mode. Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack

                If a guard check fails, program is halted. Protection has the following modes:

                - In NORMAL mode (GCC flag: -fstack-protector) only functions that call alloca, and functions with
                  buffers larger than 8 bytes are protected.

                - STRONG mode (GCC flag: -fstack-protector-strong) is like NORMAL, but includes additional functions

                  addresses.
