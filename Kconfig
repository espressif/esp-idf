config IDF_CMAKE
    bool
    option env="IDF_CMAKE"

menu "SDK tool configuration"
config TOOLPREFIX
    string "Compiler toolchain path/prefix"
    default "xtensa-esp32-elf-"
    help
        The prefix/path that is used to call the toolchain. The default setting assumes
        a crosstool-ng gcc setup that is in your PATH.

config PYTHON
    string "Python 2 interpreter"
    depends on !IDF_CMAKE
    default "python"
    help
        The executable name/path that is used to run python. On some systems Python 2.x
        may need to be invoked as python2.

        (Note: This option is used with the GNU Make build system only, not idf.py
        or CMake-based builds.)

config MAKE_WARN_UNDEFINED_VARIABLES
    bool "'make' warns on undefined variables"
    default "y"
    help
        Adds --warn-undefined-variables to MAKEFLAGS. This causes make to
        print a warning any time an undefined variable is referenced.

        This option helps find places where a variable reference is misspelled
        or otherwise missing, but it can be unwanted if you have Makefiles which
        depend on undefined variables expanding to an empty string.
