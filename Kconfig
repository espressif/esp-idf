                print a warning any time an undefined variable is referenced.

                This option helps find places where a variable reference is misspelled
                or otherwise missing, but it can be unwanted if you have Makefiles which

                Enable this option in case you have a custom toolchain which supports time_t wide 64-bits.
                This option checks time_t is 64-bits and disables ROM time functions
                to use the time functions from the toolchain instead.
                This option allows resolving the Y2K38 problem.
                See "Setup Linux Toolchain from Scratch" to build
                a custom toolchain which supports 64-bits time_t.

                Note: ESP-IDF does not currently come with any pre-compiled toolchain
                that supports 64-bit wide time_t.
                This will change in a future major release,
                but currently 64-bit time_t requires a custom built toolchain.

            default APP_BUILD_TYPE_APP_2NDBOOT
            help
                Select the way the application is built.

                By default, the application is built as a binary file in a format compatible with
                the ESP32 bootloader. In addition to this application, 2nd stage bootloader is
                also built. Application and bootloader binaries can be written into flash and
                loaded/executed from there.

                Another option, useful for only very small and limited applications, is to only link
                the .elf file of the application, such that it can be loaded directly into RAM over
                JTAG. Note that since IRAM and DRAM sizes are very limited, it is not possible to
                build any complex application this way. However for kinds of testing and debugging,
                this option may provide faster iterations, since the application does not need to be
                written into flash.
                Note that at the moment, ESP-IDF does not contain all the startup code required to
                initialize the CPUs and ROM memory (data/bss). Therefore it is necessary to execute
                a bit of ROM code prior to executing the application. A gdbinit file may look as follows:

                    # Connect to a running instance of OpenOCD
                    target remote :3333
                    # Reset and halt the target
                    mon reset halt
                    # Run to a specific point in ROM code,
                    #  where most of initialization is complete.
                    thb *0x40007901
                    c
                    # Load the application into RAM
                    load
                    # Run till app_main
                    tb app_main
                    c

                Execute this gdbinit file as follows:

                    xtensa-esp32-elf-gdb build/app-name.elf -x gdbinit

                This option sets compiler optimization level (gcc -O argument) for the app.

                - The "Default" setting will add the -0g flag to CFLAGS.
                - The "Size" setting will add the -0s flag to CFLAGS.
                - The "Performance" setting will add the -O2 flag to CFLAGS.

                The "Size" setting cause the compiled code to be smaller and faster, but
                may lead to difficulties of correlating code addresses to source file
                lines when debugging.

                The "Performance" setting causes the compiled code to be larger and faster,
                but will be easier to correlated code addresses to source file lines.

                "None" with -O0 produces compiled code without optimization.

                Note that custom optimization levels may be unsupported.

                Stack smashing protection mode. Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack
                smashing attacks. This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with vulnerable objects.
                The guards are initialized when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.
                If a guard check fails, program is halted. Protection has the following modes:

                - In NORMAL mode (GCC flag: -fstack-protector) only functions that call alloca, and functions with
                  buffers larger than 8 bytes are protected.

                - STRONG mode (GCC flag: -fstack-protector-strong) is like NORMAL, but includes additional functions
                  to be protected -- those that have local array definitions, or have references to local frame
                  addresses.

                - In OVERALL mode (GCC flag: -fstack-protector-all) all functions are protected.

                Modes have the following impact on code performance and coverage:
