    string "Compiler toolchain path/prefix"

    help
        The prefix/path that is used to call the toolchain. The default setting assumes
        a crosstool-ng gcc setup that is in your PATH.

config PYTHON
    string "Python 2 interpreter"
    default "python"
    help
        The executable name/path that is used to run python. On some systems Python 2.x
        may need to be invoked as python2.

    help
        This option sets compiler optimization level (gcc -O argument).

        - for "Release" setting, -Os flag is added to CFLAGS.
        - for "Debug" setting, -Og flag is added to CFLAGS.

        "Release" with -Os produces smaller & faster compiled code but it
        may be harder to correlated code addresses to source files when debugging.

        To add custom optimization settings, set CFLAGS and/or CPPFLAGS
        in project makefile, before including $(IDF_PATH)/make/project.mk. Note that
        custom optimization levels may be unsupported.

    default OPTIMIZATION_ASSERTIONS_ENABLED
    help
        Assertions can be:
        - Enabled. Failure will print verbose assertion details. This is the default.

        - Set to "silent" to save code size (failed assertions will abort() but user
          needs to use the aborting address to find the line number with the failed assertion.)

        - Disabled entirely (not recommended for most configurations.) -DNDEBUG is added
          to CPPFLAGS in this case.

config OPTIMIZATION_ASSERTIONS_ENABLED
    prompt "Enabled"
    bool
    help
        Enable assertions. Assertion content and line number will be printed on failure.

config OPTIMIZATION_ASSERTIONS_SILENT
    prompt "Silent (saves code size)"
    bool
    help
        Enable silent assertions. Failed assertions will abort(), user needs to
        use the aborting address to find the line number with the failed assertion.

config OPTIMIZATION_ASSERTIONS_DISABLED
    prompt "Disabled (sets -DNDEBUG)"
    bool
    help
        If assertions are disabled, -DNDEBUG is added to CPPFLAGS.
