ESP32 Modules and Boards
========================

Espressif designed and manufactured several development modules and boards to help users evaluate functionality of ESP32 chip. Development boards, depending on intended functionality, have exposed GPIO pins headers, provide USB programming interface, JTAG interface as well as peripherals like touch pads, LCD screen, SD card slot, camera module header, etc.

For details please refer to documentation below, provided together with description of particular boards.

.. _esp-modules-and-boards-esp-wrover-kit:

ESP-WROVER-KIT
--------------

This section describes several revisions of ESP-WROVER-KIT development board.

All versions of ESP-WROVER-KIT are ready to accommodate an :ref:`esp-modules-and-boards-esp-wroom-32` or :ref:`esp-modules-and-boards-esp32-wrover` module.

ESP-WROVER-KIT has dual port USB to serial converter for programming and JTAG interface for debugging. Power supply is provided by USB interface or from standard 5 mm power supply jack. Power supply selection is done with a jumper and may be put on/off with a separate switch. The board has MicroSD card slot, 3.2‚Äù SPI LCD screen and dedicated header to connect a camera. It provides RGB diode for diagnostics. Includes 32.768 kHz XTAL for internal RTC to operate it in low power modes.


.. _esp-modules-and-boards-esp-wrover-kit-v1:

ESP-WROVER-KIT V1 / ESP32 DevKitJ V1
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

First version of ESP-WROVER-KIT. Shipped with ESP-WROOM-32 on board.

.. _esp-modules-and-boards-esp-wrover-kit-v3:

ESP-WROVER-KIT V3
"""""""""""""""""

The first release of ESP-WROVER-KIT shipped with ESP32-WROVER module installed by default. This release also introduced several design changes to conditioning and interlocking of signals to the bootstrapping pins. Also, a zero Ohm resistor (R166) has been added between WROVER/WROOM module and VDD33 net, which can be desoldered, or replaced with a shunt resistor, for current measurement. This is intended to facilitate power consumption analysis in various operation modes of ESP32. Refer to schematic - the changes are enclosed in green border.
