ESP32 Modules and Boards
========================

Espressif designed and manufactured several development modules and boards to help users evaluate functionality of ESP32 chip. Development boards, depending on intended functionality, have exposed GPIO pins headers, provide USB programming interface, JTAG interface as well as peripherals like touch pads, LCD screen, SD card slot, camera module header, etc.

For details please refer to documentation below, provided together with description of particular boards.


ESP-WROOM-32
------------

The smallest module intended for installation in final products. Can be also used for evaluation after adding extra components like programming interface, boot strapping resistors and break out headers.

ESP32 Core Board V2 / ESP32 DevKitC
-----------------------------------

Small and convenient development board with break out pin headers and minimum additional components. Includes USB to serial programming interface, that also provides power supply for the board. Has press buttons to reset the board and put it in upload mode.

ESP32 Demo Board V2
-------------------

One of first feature rich evaluation boards that contains several pin headers, dip switches, USB to serial programming interface, reset and boot mode press buttons, power switch, 10 touch pads and separate header to connect LCD screen.

ESP32 WROVER KIT V1 / ESP32 DevKitJ V1
--------------------------------------

Development board that has dual port USB to serial converter for programming and JTAG interface for debugging. Power supply is provided by USB interface or from standard 5 mm power supply jack. Power supply selection is done with a jumper and may be put on/off with a separate switch. Has SD card slot, 3.2‚Äù SPI LCD screen and dedicated header to connect a camera. Provides RGB diode for diagnostics. Also, includes 32.768 kHz XTAL for internal RTC to operate it in low power modes.

ESP32 WROVER KIT V3
-------------------

This revision of ESP32 WROVER KIT introduced several changes to conditioning and interlocking of signals to the bootstrapping pins. A zero Ohm resistor (R166) has been addedd between WROVER/WROOM module and VDD33 net, which can be desoldered or replaced with a shunt resistor for current measurement. This should facilitate power consumption analysis in varius operation modes of ESP32. Refer to schematic - the changes are enclosed in green border.

The camera header has been changed from male back to female. The board soldermask is matte black.

All versions of ESP32 WROVER KIT are ready to accommodate an ESP-WROOM-32 or ESP32-WROVER module. On picture above ESP32-WROVER is installed.
