.. _esp-modules-and-boards-esp32-pico-pit-v3:

ESP32-PICO-KIT V3
-----------------

The first public release of Espressif's ESP32-PICO-D4 chip on a mini development board. The board has a USB port for programming and debugging and two rows of 20 pin headers to plug into a breadboard. The ESP32-PICO-D4 chip itself is small and requires only a few external components. Besides two core CPUs it integrates 4MB flash memory, a crystal oscillator and antenna matching components in one single 7 x 7 mm package. As a result the chip and all the components making the complete development board fit into 20 x 52 mm PCB.
