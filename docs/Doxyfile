# This is Doxygen configuration file
#
# Doxygen provides over 260 configuration statements
# To make this file easier to follow, 
# it contains only statements that are non-default
#
# NOTE:
# It is recommended not to change defaults unless specifically required
# Test any changes how they affect generated documentation
# Make sure that correct warnings are generated to flag issues with documented code
#
# For the complete list of configuration statements see:
