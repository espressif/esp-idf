# Documentation Source Folder

This folder contains source files of **ESP-IDF documentation** available in [English](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/) and [中文](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/zh_CN/latest/).

The sources do not render well in GitHub and some information is not visible at all.

Use actual documentation generated within about 20 minutes on each commit:

# Hosted Documentation

* English: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/
* 中文: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/zh_CN/latest/

The above URLs are all for the master branch latest version. Click the drop-down in the bottom left to choose a stable version or to download a PDF.

# Building Documentation

The documentation build requirements Python 3 and running the wrapper `./build_docs.py` tool. Running `./build_docs.py --help` will give a summary of available options.

See [Documenting Code](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/contribute/documenting-code.html) in the ESP-IDF Programming Guide for full information about setting up to build the docs, and how to use the `./build_docs.py` tool.
