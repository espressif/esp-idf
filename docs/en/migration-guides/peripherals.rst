Migrate Peripherals to ESP-IDF 5.0
==================================

Peripheral Clock Gating
-----------------------

As usual, peripheral clock gating is still handled by driver itself, users don't need to take care of the peripheral module clock gating.

However, for advanced users who implement their own drivers based on ``hal`` and ``soc`` components, the previous clock gating include path has been changed from ``driver/periph_ctrl.h`` to ``esp_private/periph_ctrl.h``.
