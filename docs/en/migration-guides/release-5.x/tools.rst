IDF Monitor
-----------

IDF Monitor makes the following changes regarding baud-rate:

- IDF monitor now uses the custom console baud-rate (:ref:`CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_UART_BAUDRATE`) by default instead of 115200.
- Setting a custom baud from menuconfig is no longer supported.
- A custom baud-rate can be specified from command line with the ``idf.py monitor -b <baud>`` command or through setting environment variables.
- Please note that the baud-rate argument has been renamed from ``-B`` to ``-b`` in order to be consistent with the global baud-rate ``idf.py -b <baud>``. Run ``idf.py monitor --help`` for more information.

Deprecated Commands
-------------------

``idf.py`` sub-commands and ``cmake`` target names have been unified to use hyphens (``-``) instead of underscores (``_``). Using a deprecated sub-command or target name will produce a warning. Users are advised to migrate to using the new sub-commands and target names. The following changes have been made:

Esptool
-------

The CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_DETECT option has been renamed to :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_HEADER_FLASHSIZE_UPDATE` and has been disabled by default. New and existing projects migrated to ESP-IDF v5.0 will have to set :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE`. If this is not possible due to an unknown flash size at build time, then :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_HEADER_FLASHSIZE_UPDATE` can be enabled. However, once enabled, to keep the digest valid, a SHA256 digest will no longer be appended to the image when updating the binary header with the flash size during flashing.

Windows Environment
--------------------

The Msys/Mingw-based Windows environment support got deprecated in ESP-IDF v4.0 and was entirely removed in v5.0. Please use :ref:`get-started-windows-tools-installer` to set up a compatible environment. The options include Windows Command Line, Power Shell and the graphical user interface based on Eclipse IDE. In addition, a VS Code-based environment can be set up with the supported plugin: https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension.
