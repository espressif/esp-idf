Migrate Windows Environment to ESP-IDF 5.0
==========================================

The Msys/Mingw-based Windows environment support got deprecated in ESP-IDF v4.0 and was entirely removed in v5.0. Please use :ref:`get-started-windows-tools-installer` to set up a compatible environment. The options include Windows Command Line, Power Shell and the graphical user interface based on Eclipse IDE. In addition, a VS Code-based environment can be set up with the supported plugin: https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension.
