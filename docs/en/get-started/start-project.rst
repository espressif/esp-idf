Build the Project
=================

Build the project by running:

.. code-block:: batch

    idf.py build

This command will compile the application and all ESP-IDF components, then it will generate the bootloader, partition table, and application binaries.

.. code-block:: none

    $ idf.py build
    Running cmake in directory /path/to/hello_world/build
    Executing "cmake -G Ninja --warn-uninitialized /path/to/hello_world"...
    Warn about uninitialized values.
    -- Found Git: /usr/bin/git (found version "2.17.0")

    -- Component names: ...
    -- Component paths: ...

    ... (more lines of build system output)

    [527/527] Generating hello_world.bin
    esptool.py v2.3.1

    Project build complete. To flash, run this command:
    ../../../components/esptool_py/esptool/esptool.py -p (PORT) -b 921600 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size detect --flash_freq 40m 0x10000 build/hello_world.bin  build 0x1000 build/bootloader/bootloader.bin 0x8000 build/partition_table/partition-table.bin
    or run 'idf.py -p PORT flash'

If there are no errors, the build will finish by generating the firmware binary .bin files.


Flash onto the Device
=====================

To flash the binaries that you just built for the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} in the previous step, you need to run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    idf.py -p PORT flash

Replace ``PORT`` with your {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board's USB port name. If the ``PORT`` is not defined, the :ref:`idf.py` will try to connect automatically using the available USB ports.

For more information on ``idf.py`` arguments, see :ref:`idf.py`.

.. note::

    The option ``flash`` automatically builds and flashes the project, so running ``idf.py build`` is not necessary.

Encountered Issues While Flashing? See this :doc:`flashing-troubleshooting` page or :doc:`establish-serial-connection` for more detailed information.

Normal Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When flashing, you will see the output log similar to the following:

If there are no issues by the end of the flash process, the board will reboot and start up the “hello_world” application.

If you'd like to use the Eclipse or VS Code IDE instead of running ``idf.py``, check out `Eclipse Plugin <https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md>`_, `VSCode Extension <https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/tutorial/install.md>`_.

Monitor the Output
==================

To check if "hello_world" is indeed running, type ``idf.py -p PORT monitor`` (Do not forget to replace PORT with your serial port name).

This command launches the :doc:`IDF Monitor <../api-guides/tools/idf-monitor>` application::

    $ idf.py -p <PORT> monitor
    Running idf_monitor in directory [...]/esp/hello_world/build
    Executing "python [...]/esp-idf/tools/idf_monitor.py -b 115200 [...]/esp/hello_world/build/hello_world.elf"...

    rst:0x1 (POWERON_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)
    ets Jun  8 2016 00:22:57
    ...

After startup and diagnostic logs scroll up, you should see "Hello world!" printed out by the application.

.. code-block:: none

        ...

        Restarting in 9 seconds...
        Restarting in 8 seconds...
        Restarting in 7 seconds...

To exit IDF monitor use the shortcut ``Ctrl+]``.

.. only:: esp32 or esp32c2

    If IDF monitor fails shortly after the upload, or, if instead of the messages above, you see random garbage similar to what is given below, your board is likely using a 26 MHz crystal. Most development board designs use 40 MHz, so ESP-IDF uses this frequency as a default value.

    .. figure:: ../../_static/get-started-garbled-output.png
        :align: center
        :alt: Garbled output
        :figclass: align-center

    If you have such a problem, do the following:

    1. Exit the monitor.
    2. Go back to ``menuconfig``.
    3. Go to ``Component config`` --> ``Hardware Settings`` --> ``Main XTAL Config`` --> ``Main XTAL frequency``, then change :ref:`CONFIG_XTAL_FREQ_SEL` to 26 MHz.
    4. After that, ``build and flash`` the application again.

    In the current version of ESP-IDF, main XTAL frequencies supported by {IDF_TARGET_NAME} are as follows:

    .. list::

        :SOC_XTAL_SUPPORT_24M: - 24 MHz
        :SOC_XTAL_SUPPORT_26M: - 26 MHz
        :SOC_XTAL_SUPPORT_32M: - 32 MHz
        :SOC_XTAL_SUPPORT_40M: - 40 MHz

.. note::

    You can combine building, flashing and monitoring into one step by running::

        idf.py -p PORT flash monitor

See also:

- :doc:`IDF Monitor <../api-guides/tools/idf-monitor>` for handy shortcuts and more details on using IDF monitor.
- :ref:`idf.py` for a full reference of ``idf.py`` commands and options.

**That's all that you need to get started with {IDF_TARGET_NAME}!**

Now you are ready to try some other :idf:`examples`, or go straight to developing your own applications.

.. important::

    Some of examples do not support {IDF_TARGET_NAME} because required hardware is not included in {IDF_TARGET_NAME} so it cannot be supported.

    If building an example, please check the README file for the ``Supported Targets`` table. If this is present including {IDF_TARGET_NAME} target, or the table does not exist at all, the example will work on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.


Additional Tips
===============

Permission issues /dev/ttyUSB0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With some Linux distributions, you may get the ``Failed to open port /dev/ttyUSB0`` error message when flashing the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. :ref:`This can be solved by adding the current user to the dialout group<linux-dialout-group>`.

Python compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ESP-IDF supports Python 3.7 or newer. It is recommended to upgrade your operating system to a recent version satisfying this requirement. Other options include the installation of Python from `sources <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ or the use of a Python version management system such as `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_.

.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2 or esp32s3

    ..
        When adding new targets to the line above, please update this list in windows-start-project.rst and linux-macos-start-project.rst


    Start with Board Support Package
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    To speed up prototyping on some development boards, you can use `Board Support Packages (BSPs) <https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp>`_, which makes initialization of a particular board as easy as few function calls.

    A BSP typically supports all of the hardware components provided on development board. Apart from the pinout definition and initialization functions, a BSP ships with drivers for the external components such as sensors, displays, audio codecs etc.

    The BSPs are distributed via :doc:`IDF Component Manager </api-guides/tools/idf-component-manager>`, so they can be found in `IDF Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com>`_.

    .. only:: esp32

        **Here's an example of how to add ESP-WROVER-KIT BSP to your project:**

        .. code-block:: bash

            idf.py add-dependency esp_wrover_kit

    .. only:: esp32s2

        **Here's an example of how to add ESP32-S2-Kaluga-Kit BSP to your project:**

        .. code-block:: bash

            idf.py add-dependency esp32_s2_kaluga_kit

    .. only:: esp32s3

        **Here's an example of how to add ESP-BOX BSP to your project:**

        .. code-block:: bash

            idf.py add-dependency esp-box

    More examples of BSP usage can be found in `BSP examples folder <https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp/tree/master/examples>`_.

Flash Erase
~~~~~~~~~~~

Erasing the flash is also possible. To erase the entire flash memory you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    idf.py -p PORT erase-flash

For erasing the OTA data, if present, you can run this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    idf.py -p PORT erase-otadata

The flash erase command can take a while to be done. Do not disconnect your device while the flash erasing is in progress.
