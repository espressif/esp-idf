:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

ESP-IDF V4.0 will be released with a new CMake-based build system as the default build system.

Eclipse CDT IDE support for CMake-based build system will be available before the ESP-IDF V4.0 release but
is not available yet. We apologise for the inconvenience.

If you require Eclipse IDE support for this pre-release version of ESP-IDF, you can follow the :doc:`legacy GNU Make build system Getting Started guide </get-started-legacy/index>` which has steps for :doc:`Building and Flashing with Eclipse IDE </get-started-legacy/eclipse-setup>`.
