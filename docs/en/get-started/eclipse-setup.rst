ESP-IDF V4.0 has a new CMake-based build system as the default build system.

And, we also have IDF Eclipse Plugins to support the new CMake-based build system. Please refer to https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin for further instructions.

If you require Eclipse IDE support for legacy ESP_IDF Make build system, you can follow the :doc:`legacy GNU Make build system Getting Started guide </get-started-legacy/index>` which has steps for :doc:`Building and Flashing with Eclipse IDE </get-started-legacy/eclipse-setup>`.
