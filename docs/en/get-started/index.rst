.. _get-started-get-prerequisites:

Step 1. Install prerequisites
=============================

Some tools need to be installed on the computer before proceeding to the next steps. Follow the links below for the instructions for your OS:

.. _Windows: ../get-started/windows-setup.html
.. _Linux: ../get-started/linux-setup.html
.. _Mac OS: ../get-started/macos-setup.html

.. note::

    This guide uses the directory ``~/esp`` on Linux and macOS or ``%userprofile%\esp`` on Windows as an installation folder for ESP-IDF. You can use any directory, but you will need to adjust paths for the commands respectively. Keep in mind that ESP-IDF does not support spaces in paths.

.. _get-started-get-esp-idf:

Step 2. Get ESP-IDF
===================

To build applications for the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, you need the software libraries provided by Espressif in `ESP-IDF repository <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf>`_.

To get ESP-IDF, navigate to your installation directory and clone the repository with ``git clone``, following instructions below specific to your operating system.

Linux and macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open Terminal, and run the following commands:

.. include-build-file:: inc/git-clone-bash.inc

ESP-IDF will be downloaded into ``~/esp/esp-idf``.

Consult :doc:`/versions` for information about which ESP-IDF version to use in a given situation.

Windows
~~~~~~~

In addition to installing the tools, :ref:`get-started-windows-tools-installer` for Windows introduced in Step 1 can also download a copy of ESP-IDF.

Consult :doc:`/versions` for information about which ESP-IDF version to use in a given situation.

If you wish to download ESP-IDF without the help of ESP-IDF Tools Installer, refer to these :ref:`instructions <get-esp-idf-windows-command-line>`.

.. _get-started-set-up-tools:

Step 3. Set up the tools
========================

Aside from the ESP-IDF, you also need to install the tools used by ESP-IDF, such as the compiler, debugger, Python packages, etc.

Windows
~~~~~~~

:ref:`get-started-windows-tools-installer` for Windows introduced in Step 1 installs all the required tools.

If you want to install the tools without the help of ESP-IDF Tools Installer, open the Command Prompt and follow these steps:

.. code-block:: batch

    cd %userprofile%\esp\esp-idf
    install.bat

or with Windows PowerShell

.. code-block:: powershell

    cd ~/esp/esp-idf
    ./install.ps1

Linux and macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/esp/esp-idf
    ./install.sh

Alternative File Downloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tools installer downloads a number of files attached to GitHub Releases. If accessing GitHub is slow then it is possible to set an environment variable to prefer Espressif's download server for GitHub asset downloads.

.. note:: This setting only controls individual tools downloaded from GitHub releases, it doesn't change the URLs used to access any Git repositories.

Windows
-------

To prefer the Espressif download server when running the ESP-IDF Tools Installer check out the following option in the installer window: ``Use Espressif download server instead of downloading tool packages from GitHub.``

.. figure:: ../../_static/esp-idf-installer-download-server.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Configuring the ESP-IDF Tools Setup Wizard Espressif download server
    :figclass: align-center

    Configuring the ESP-IDF Tools Setup Wizard Espressif download server

Linux and macOS
---------------

To prefer the Espressif download server when installing tools, use the following sequence of commands when running ``install.sh``:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/esp/esp-idf
    export IDF_GITHUB_ASSETS="dl.espressif.com/github_assets"
    ./install.sh

Customizing the tools installation path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The scripts introduced in this step install compilation tools required by ESP-IDF inside the user home directory: ``$HOME/.espressif`` on Linux and macOS, ``%USERPROFILE%\.espressif`` on Windows. If you wish to install the tools into a different directory, set the environment variable ``IDF_TOOLS_PATH`` before running the installation scripts. Make sure that your user account has sufficient permissions to read and write this path.

If changing the ``IDF_TOOLS_PATH``, make sure it is set to the same value every time the Install script (``install.bat``, ``install.ps1`` or ``install.sh``) and an Export script (``export.bat``, ``export.ps1`` or ``export.sh``) are executed.

.. _get-started-set-up-env:


Step 4. Set up the environment variables
========================================

The installed tools are not yet added to the PATH environment variable. To make the tools usable from the command line, some environment variables must be set. ESP-IDF provides another script which does that.

Windows
~~~~~~~

:ref:`get-started-windows-tools-installer` for Windows creates an "ESP-IDF Command Prompt" shortcut in the Start Menu. This shortcut opens the Command Prompt and sets up all the required environment variables. You can open this shortcut and proceed to the next step.

Alternatively, if you want to use ESP-IDF in an existing Command Prompt window, you can run:

.. code-block:: batch

    %userprofile%\esp\esp-idf\export.bat

or with Windows PowerShell

.. code-block:: powershell

    .$HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.ps1

.. _get-started-export:

Linux and macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the terminal where you are going to use ESP-IDF, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    . $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh

or for fish (supported only since fish version 3.0.0):

.. code-block:: bash

    . $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.fish

Note the space between the leading dot and the path!

If you plan to use esp-idf frequently, you can create an alias for executing ``export.sh``:

1.  Copy and paste the following command to your shell's profile (``.profile``, ``.bashrc``, ``.zprofile``, etc.)

    .. code-block:: bash

        alias get_idf='. $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh'

2.  Refresh the configuration by restarting the terminal session or by running ``source [path to profile]``, for example, ``source ~/.bashrc``.

Now you can run ``get_idf`` to set up or refresh the esp-idf environment in any terminal session.

Technically, you can add ``export.sh`` to your shell's profile directly; however, it is not recommended. Doing so activates IDF virtual environment in every terminal session (including those where IDF is not needed), defeating the purpose of the virtual environment and likely affecting other software.

.. _get-started-start-project:

Step 5. Start a Project
=======================

Now you are ready to prepare your application for {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. You can start with :example:`get-started/hello_world` project from :idf:`examples` directory in IDF.

Copy the project :example:`get-started/hello_world` to ``~/esp`` directory:

Linux and macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/esp
    cp -r $IDF_PATH/examples/get-started/hello_world .

Windows
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: batch

    cd %userprofile%\esp
    xcopy /e /i %IDF_PATH%\examples\get-started\hello_world hello_world

There is a range of example projects in the :idf:`examples` directory in ESP-IDF. You can copy any project in the same way as presented above and run it.

It is also possible to build examples in-place, without copying them first.

.. important::

    The ESP-IDF build system does not support spaces in the paths to either ESP-IDF or to projects.

.. _get-started-connect:

Step 6. Connect Your Device
===========================

Now connect your {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board to the computer and check under what serial port the board is visible.

Serial ports have the following patterns in their names:

- **Windows**: names like ``COM1``
- **Linux**: starting with ``/dev/tty``
- **macOS**: starting with ``/dev/cu.``

If you are not sure how to check the serial port name, please refer to :doc:`establish-serial-connection` for full details.

.. note::

    Keep the port name handy as you will need it in the next steps.


.. _get-started-configure:

Step 7. Configure
=================

Navigate to your ``hello_world`` directory from :ref:`get-started-start-project`, set {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip as the target and run the project configuration utility ``menuconfig``.

Linux and macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/esp/hello_world
    idf.py set-target {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}
    idf.py menuconfig

Windows
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: batch

    cd %userprofile%\esp\hello_world
    idf.py set-target {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}
    idf.py menuconfig

Setting the target with ``idf.py set-target {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}`` should be done once, after opening a new project. If the project contains some existing builds and configuration, they will be cleared and initialized. The target may be saved in environment variable to skip this step at all. See :ref:`selecting-idf-target` for additional information.

If the previous steps have been done correctly, the following menu appears:

.. figure:: ../../_static/project-configuration.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Project configuration - Home window
    :figclass: align-center

    Project configuration - Home window

You are using this menu to set up project specific variables, e.g. Wi-Fi network name and password, the processor speed, etc. Setting up the project with menuconfig may be skipped for "hello_word". This example will run with default configuration.

.. only:: esp32

    .. attention::

        If you use ESP32-DevKitC board with the **ESP32-SOLO-1** module, enable single core mode (:ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE`) in menuconfig before flashing examples.

.. note::

    The colors of the menu could be different in your terminal. You can change the appearance with the option
    ``--style``. Please run ``idf.py menuconfig --help`` for further information.

.. _get-started-build:

Step 8. Build the Project
=========================

Build the project by running:

.. code-block:: batch

    idf.py build

This command will compile the application and all ESP-IDF components, then it will generate the bootloader, partition table, and application binaries.

.. code-block:: none

   $ idf.py build
   Running cmake in directory /path/to/hello_world/build
   Executing "cmake -G Ninja --warn-uninitialized /path/to/hello_world"...
   Warn about uninitialized values.
   -- Found Git: /usr/bin/git (found version "2.17.0")
   -- Building empty aws_iot component due to configuration
   -- Component names: ...
   -- Component paths: ...

   ... (more lines of build system output)

   [527/527] Generating hello-world.bin
   esptool.py v2.3.1

   Project build complete. To flash, run this command:
   ../../../components/esptool_py/esptool/esptool.py -p (PORT) -b 921600 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size detect --flash_freq 40m 0x10000 build/hello-world.bin  build 0x1000 build/bootloader/bootloader.bin 0x8000 build/partition_table/partition-table.bin
   or run 'idf.py -p PORT flash'

If there are no errors, the build will finish by generating the firmware binary .bin files.


.. _get-started-flash:

Step 9. Flash onto the Device
=============================

Flash the binaries that you just built (bootloader.bin, partition-table.bin and hello-world.bin) onto your {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    idf.py -p PORT [-b BAUD] flash

Replace PORT with your {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board's serial port name from :ref:`get-started-connect`.

You can also change the flasher baud rate by replacing BAUD with the baud rate you need. The default baud rate is ``460800``.

For more information on idf.py arguments, see :ref:`idf.py`.

.. note::

    The option ``flash`` automatically builds and flashes the project, so running ``idf.py build`` is not necessary.


Encountered Issues While Flashing?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{IDF_TARGET_STRAP_GPIO:default="GPIO0", esp32="GPIO0", esp32s2="GPIO0", esp32c3="GPIO9"}

If you run the given command and see errors such as "Failed to connect", there might be several reasons for this. One of the reasons might be issues encountered by ``esptool.py``, the utility that is called by the build system to reset the chip, interact with the ROM bootloader, and flash firmware. One simple solution to try is manual reset described below, and if it does not help you can find more details about possible issues in `Troubleshooting <https://github.com/espressif/esptool#bootloader-wont-respond>`_.

``esptool.py`` resets {IDF_TARGET_NAME} automatically by asserting DTR and RTS control lines of the USB to serial converter chip, i.e., FTDI or CP210x (for more information, see :doc:`establish-serial-connection`). The DTR and RTS control lines are in turn connected to ``{IDF_TARGET_STRAP_GPIO}`` and ``CHIP_PU`` (EN) pins of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, thus changes in the voltage levels of DTR and RTS will boot {IDF_TARGET_NAME} into Firmware Download mode. As an example, check the `schematic <https://dl.espressif.com/dl/schematics/esp32_devkitc_v4-sch-20180607a.pdf>`_ for the ESP32 DevKitC development board.

In general, you should have no problems with the official esp-idf development boards. However, ``esptool.py`` is not able to reset your hardware automatically in the following cases:

- Your hardware does not have the DTR and RTS lines connected to ``{IDF_TARGET_STRAP_GPIO}`` and ``CHIP_PU``
- The DTR and RTS lines are configured differently
- There are no such serial control lines at all

Depending on the kind of hardware you have, it may also be possible to manually put your {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board into Firmware Download mode (reset).

- For development boards produced by Espressif, this information can be found in the respective getting started guides or user guides. For example, to manually reset an esp-idf development board, hold down the **Boot** button (``{IDF_TARGET_STRAP_GPIO}``) and press the **EN** button (``CHIP_PU``).
- For other types of hardware, try pulling ``{IDF_TARGET_STRAP_GPIO}`` down.

If there are no issues by the end of the flash process, the board will reboot and start up the “hello_world” application.

If you'd like to use the Eclipse or VS Code IDE instead of running ``idf.py``, check out the :doc:`Eclipse guide <eclipse-setup>`, :doc:`VS Code guide <vscode-setup>`.


.. _get-started-build-monitor:

Step 10. Monitor
================

To check if "hello_world" is indeed running, type ``idf.py -p PORT monitor`` (Do not forget to replace PORT with your serial port name).

This command launches the :doc:`IDF Monitor <../api-guides/tools/idf-monitor>` application::

    $ idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 monitor
    Running idf_monitor in directory [...]/esp/hello_world/build
    Executing "python [...]/esp-idf/tools/idf_monitor.py -b 115200 [...]/esp/hello_world/build/hello-world.elf"...
    --- idf_monitor on /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 ---
    --- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---
    ets Jun  8 2016 00:22:57

    rst:0x1 (POWERON_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)
    ets Jun  8 2016 00:22:57
    ...

After startup and diagnostic logs scroll up, you should see "Hello world!" printed out by the application.

.. code-block:: none

    	...
    	Hello world!
    	Restarting in 10 seconds...
    	This is {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME} chip with {IDF_TARGET_CORE_NUM} CPU core(s), {IDF_TARGET_FEATURES}
	Minimum free heap size: {IDF_TARGET_HEAP_SIZE} bytes
    	Restarting in 9 seconds...
    	Restarting in 8 seconds...
    	Restarting in 7 seconds...

To exit IDF monitor use the shortcut ``Ctrl+]``.

.. only:: esp32

    If IDF monitor fails shortly after the upload, or, if instead of the messages above, you see random garbage similar to what is given below, your board is likely using a 26 MHz crystal. Most development board designs use 40 MHz, so ESP-IDF uses this frequency as a default value.

    .. figure:: ../../_static/get-started-garbled-output.png
        :align: center
        :alt: Garbled output
        :figclass: align-center

    If you have such a problem, do the following:

    1. Exit the monitor.
    2. Go back to :ref:`menuconfig <get-started-configure>`.
    3. Go to Component config --> ESP32-specific --> Main XTAL frequency, then change :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32_XTAL_FREQ_SEL` to 26 MHz.
    4. After that, :ref:`build and flash <get-started-flash>` the application again.

.. note::

    You can combine building, flashing and monitoring into one step by running::

       idf.py -p PORT flash monitor

See also:

- :doc:`IDF Monitor <../api-guides/tools/idf-monitor>` for handy shortcuts and more details on using IDF monitor.
- :ref:`idf.py` for a full reference of ``idf.py`` commands and options.

**That's all that you need to get started with {IDF_TARGET_NAME}!**

Now you are ready to try some other :idf:`examples`, or go straight to developing your own applications.

.. important::

    Some of examples do not support {IDF_TARGET_NAME} because required hardware is not included in {IDF_TARGET_NAME} so it cannot be supported.

    If building an example, please check the README file for the ``Supported Targets`` table. If this is present including {IDF_TARGET_NAME} target, or the table does not exist at all, the example will work on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.


Updating ESP-IDF
================

You should update ESP-IDF from time to time, as newer versions fix bugs and provide new features. The simplest way to do the update is to delete the existing ``esp-idf`` folder and clone it again, as if performing the initial installation described in :ref:`get-started-get-esp-idf`.

Another solution is to update only what has changed. :ref:`The update procedure depends on the version of ESP-IDF you are using <updating>`.

After updating ESP-IDF, execute the Install script again, in case the new ESP-IDF version requires different versions of tools. See instructions at :ref:`get-started-set-up-tools`.

Once the new tools are installed, update the environment using the Export script. See instructions at :ref:`get-started-set-up-env`.
