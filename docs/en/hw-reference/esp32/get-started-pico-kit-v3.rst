ESP32-PICO-KIT V3 Getting Started Guide
=======================================
:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

This guide shows how to get started with the ESP32-PICO-KIT V3 mini development board. For the description of other ESP32-PICO-KIT versions, please check :doc:`../../hw-reference/index`.


What You Need
-------------

* ESP32-PICO-KIT V3 mini development board
* USB 2.0 A to Micro B cable
* Computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS

You can skip the introduction sections and go directly to Section `Start Application Development`_.


Overview
--------

ESP32-PICO-KIT V3 is an ESP32-based mini development board produced by `Espressif <https://espressif.com>`_. The core of this board is ESP32-PICO-D4 - a System-in-Package (SiP) module.

The development board features a USB-UART Bridge circuit, which allows developers to connect the board to a computer's USB port for flashing and debugging.

All the IO signals and system power on ESP32-PICO-D4 are led out to two rows of 20 x 0.1" header pads on both sides of the development board for easy access.


Functional Description

Key Component       Description
==================  =================================================================================================================================
ESP32-PICO-D4       Standard ESP32-PICO-D4 module soldered to the ESP32-PICO-KIT V3 board. The complete ESP32 system on a chip (ESP32 SoC) has been integrated into the SiP module, requiring only an external antenna with LC matching network, decoupling capacitors, and a pull-up resistor for EN signals to function properly.

LDO                 5V-to-3.3V Low dropout voltage regulator (LDO).

USB-UART bridge     Single-chip USB-UART bridge provides up to 1 Mbps transfers rates.

Micro USB Port      USB interface. Power supply for the board as well as the communication interface between a computer and the board.

Power On LED        This red LED turns on when power is supplied to the board.

I/O                 All the pins on ESP32-PICO-D4 are broken out to pin headers. You can program ESP32 to enable multiple functions, such as PWM, ADC, DAC, I2C, I2S, SPI, etc.

BOOT Button         Download button. Holding down **Boot** and then pressing **EN** initiates Firmware Download mode for downloading firmware through the serial port.

EN Button           Reset button.

Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up your ESP32-PICO-KIT V3, please make sure that the board is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.

After that, proceed to :doc:`../../get-started/index`, where Section :ref:`get-started-step-by-step` will quickly help you set up the development environment and then flash an example project onto your board.
