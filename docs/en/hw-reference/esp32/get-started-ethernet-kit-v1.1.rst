Overview
--------

ESP32-Ethernet-Kit is an ESP32-based development board produced by `Espressif <https://espressif.com>`_.

It consists of two development boards, the Ethernet board A and the PoE board B. The :ref:`Ethernet board (A) <get-started-esp32-ethernet-kit-a-v1.1-layout>` contains Bluetooth / Wi-Fi dual-mode ESP32-WROVER-B module and IP101GRI, a Single Port 10/100 Fast Ethernet Transceiver (PHY). The `PoE board (B)`_ provides power over Ethernet functionality. The A board can work independently, without the board B installed.

PoE Board (B)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This board coverts power delivered over the Ethernet cable (PoE) to provide a power supply for the Ethernet board (A). The main components of the PoE board (B) are shown on the block diagram under `Functionality Overview`_.

The PoE board (B) has the following features:

* Support for IEEE 802.3at
* Power output: 5 V, 1.4 A

To take advantage of the PoE functionality the **RJ45 Port** of the Ethernet board (A) should be connected with an Ethernet cable to a switch that supports PoE. When the Ethernet board (A) detects 5 V power output from the PoE board (B), the USB power will be automatically cut off.

Setup Options
-------------

This section describes options to configure the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit hardware.


Function Switch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When in On position, this DIP switch is routing listed GPIOs to FT2232H to provide JTAG functionality. When in Off position, the GPIOs may be used for other purposes.

=======  ================
DIP SW   GPIO Pin
=======  ================
 1       GPIO13
 2       GPIO12
 3       GPIO15
 4       GPIO14
=======  ================

.. note::

    Placement of GPIO pin number marking on the board's silkscreen besides the DIP switch is incorrect. Please use instead the pin order as in the table above.


RMII Clock Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ethernet MAC and PHY under RMII working mode need a common 50 MHz reference clock (i.e. RMII clock) that can be provided either externally, or generated from internal ESP32 APLL. 

.. note::

    For additional information on the RMII clock selection, please refer to `ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.1 Ethernet board (A) schematic`_, sheet 2, location D2.


RMII Clock Sourced Externally by PHY
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

By default, the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit is configured to provide RMII clock for the IP101GRI PHY's 50M_CLKO output. The clock signal is generated by the frequency multiplication of 25 MHz crystal connected to the PHY. For details, please see the figure below.

.. figure:: ../../../_static/esp32-ethernet-kit-rmii-clk-from-phy.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%
    :alt: RMII Clock from IP101GRI PHY
    :figclass: align-center

    RMII Clock from IP101GRI PHY

Please note that the PHY is reset on power up by pulling the RESET_N signal down with a resistor. ESP32 should assert RESET_N high with GPIO5 to enable PHY. Only this can ensure the power-up of system. Otherwise ESP32 may enter download mode (when the clock signal of REF_CLK_50M is at a high logic level during the GPIO0 power-up sampling phase).


RMII Clock Sourced Internally from ESP32's APLL
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Another option is to source the RMII Clock from internal ESP32 APLL, see figure below. The clock signal coming from GPIO0 is first inverted, to account for transmission line delay, and then supplied to the PHY.

.. figure:: ../../../_static/esp32-ethernet-kit-rmii-clk-to-phy.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%
    :alt: RMII Clock from ESP Internal APLL
    :figclass: align-center

    RMII Clock from ESP Internal APLL

To implement this option, users need to remove or add some RC components on the board. For details please refer to `ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.1 Ethernet board (A) schematic`_, sheet 2, location D2. Please note that if the APLL is already used for other purposes (e.g. I2S peripheral), then you have no choice but use an external RMII clock.


GPIO Allocation
---------------

This section describes allocation of ESP32 GPIOs to specific interfaces or functions of the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit.


IP101GRI (PHY) Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The allocation of the ESP32 (MAC) pins to IP101GRI (PHY) is shown in the table below. Implementation of ESP32-Ethernet-Kit defaults to Reduced Media-Independent Interface (RMII).

====  ================  ===============

.. note::

    Except for REF_CLK, the allocation of all pins under the ESP32's *RMII Interface* is fixed and cannot be changed either through IOMUX or GPIO Matrix.

10    3V3         3.3 V power supply
====  ==========  ====================

.. note::

    1. The ESP32 pins GPIO16 and GPIO17 are not broken out to the ESP32-WROVER-B module and therefore not available for use. If you need to use these pins, please solder a module without PSRAM memory inside, e.g. the ESP32-WROOM-32D or ESP32-SOLO-1.

    2. Functionality depends on the settings of the `Function Switch`_.

.. note::

    1. To prevent the power-on state of the GPIO0 from being affected by the clock output on the PHY side, the RESET_N signal to PHY defaults to low, turning the clock output off. After power-on you can control RESET_N with GPIO5 to turn the clock output on. See also `RMII Clock Sourced Externally by PHY`_. For PHYs that cannot turn off the clock output through RESET_N, it is recommended to use a crystal module that can be disabled / enabled externally. Similarly like when using RESET_N, the oscillator module should be disabled by default and turned on by ESP32 after power-up. For a reference design please see `ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.1 Ethernet board (A) schematic`_.

    2. The ESP32 pins GPIO16 and GPIO17 are not broken out to the ESP32-WROVER-B module and therefore not available for use. If you need to use these pins, please solder a module without PSRAM memory inside, e.g. the ESP32-WROOM-32D or ESP32-SOLO-1.


Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up your ESP32-Ethernet-Kit, please make sure that the board is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.


Initial Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Set the **Function Switch** on the :ref:`Ethernet board (A) <get-started-esp32-ethernet-kit-a-v1.1-layout>` to its default position by turning all the switches to **ON**.
2. To simplify flashing and testing of the application, do not input extra signals to the board headers.
3. The `PoE board (B)`_ can now be plugged in, but do not connect external power to it.
4. Connect the :ref:`Ethernet board (A) <get-started-esp32-ethernet-kit-a-v1.1-layout>` to the PC with a USB cable.
5. Turn the **Power Switch** from GND to 5V0 position, the **5V Power On LED** should light up.


Now to Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Proceed to :doc:`../../get-started/index`, where Section :ref:`get-started-step-by-step` will quickly help you set up the development environment and then flash an example project onto your board.

Move on to the next section only if you have successfully completed all the above steps.


Configure and Load the Ethernet Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After setting up the development environment and testing the board, you can configure and flash the :example:`ethernet/basic` example. This example has been created for testing Ethernet functionality. It supports different PHY, including **IP101GRI** installed on :ref:`get-started-esp32-ethernet-kit-v1.1`.


Summary of Changes from ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.0
-----------------------------------------------

* The original inverted clock provided to the PHY by ESP32 using GPIO0 has been replaced by a clock generated on PHY side. The PHY's clock is connected to the ESP32 with same GPIO0. The GPIO2 which was originally used to control the active crystal oscillator on the PHY side, can now be used for other purposes.
* On power up, the ESP32 boot strapping pin GPIO0 may be affected by clock generated on the PHY side. To resolve this issue the PHY's Reset-N signal is pulled low using resistor R17 and effectively turning off the PHY's clock output. The Reset-N signal can be then pulled high by ESP32 using GPIO5.
* Removed FT2232H chip's external SPI Flash U6.
* Removed flow control jumper header J4.
* Removed nTRST JTAG signal. The corresponding GPIO4 can now be used for other purposes.
* Pull-up resistor R68 on the GPIO15 line is moved to the MTDO side of JTAG.
* To make the A and B board connections more foolproof (reduce chances of plugging in the B board in reverse orientation), the original two 4-pin male rows on board A were changed to one 4-pin female row and one 4-pin male row. Corresponding male and female 4-pins rows were installed on board B.
