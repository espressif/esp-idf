Overview
===========

ESP32-PICO-DevKitM-2 is an ESP32-based development board produced by `Espressif <https://espressif.com>`_.

The core of this board is `ESP32-PICO-MINI-02(02U) <https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules>`_ module with complete Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionalities. The development board features a USB-to-UART Bridge circuit which allows developers to connect the board to a computer's USB port for flashing and debugging.

All the IO signals and system power on ESP32-PICO-MINI-02(02U) are led out to two rows of 18 x 0.1" header pads on both sides of the development board for easy access. For compatibility with Dupont wires, all header pads are populated with two rows of male pin headers.

.. note::

    ESP32-PICO-DevKitM-2 comes with male headers by default.

ESP32-PICO-DevKitM-2 provides the users with hardware for development of applications based on the ESP32, making it easier for users to explore ESP32 functionalities.

.. _get-started-pico-devkitm-2-pin-notes:

.. note::

    1. This pin is connected to the pin of the USB bridge chip on the board.
    2. 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator:
       a) input
       b) output
    3. The operating voltage of ESP32-PICO-DevKitM-2’s embedded SPI flash is 3.3 V. Therefore, the strapping pin MTDI should be pulled down during the module power-on reset. If connected, please make sure that this pin is not held up on reset.
