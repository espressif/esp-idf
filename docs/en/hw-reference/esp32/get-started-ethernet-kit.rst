Overview
--------

ESP32-Ethernet-Kit is an ESP32-based development board produced by `Espressif <https://espressif.com>`_.

It consists of two development boards, the Ethernet board A and the PoE board B. The :ref:`Ethernet board (A) <get-started-esp32-ethernet-kit-a-v1.2-layout>` contains Bluetooth/Wi-Fi dual-mode ESP32-WROVER-E module and IP101GRI, a Single Port 10/100 Fast Ethernet Transceiver (PHY). The `PoE board (B)`_ provides power over Ethernet functionality. The A board can work independently, without the board B installed.

Setup Options
-------------

This section describes options to configure the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit hardware.


Function Switch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When in On position, this DIP switch is routing listed GPIOs to FT2232H to provide JTAG functionality. When in Off position, the GPIOs may be used for other purposes.

=======  ================
DIP SW   GPIO Pin
=======  ================
 1       GPIO13
 2       GPIO12
 3       GPIO15
 4       GPIO14
=======  ================


RMII Clock Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ethernet MAC and PHY under RMII working mode need a common 50 MHz reference clock (i.e. RMII clock) that can be provided either externally, or generated from internal ESP32 APLL (not recommended). 

.. note::

    For additional information on the RMII clock selection, please refer to `ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.2 Ethernet board (A) schematic`_, sheet 2, location D2.


RMII Clock Sourced Externally by PHY
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

By default, the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit is configured to provide RMII clock for the IP101GRI PHY's 50M_CLKO output. The clock signal is generated by the frequency multiplication of 25 MHz crystal connected to the PHY. For details, please see the figure below.

.. figure:: ../../../_static/esp32-ethernet-kit-rmii-clk-from-phy.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%
    :alt: RMII Clock from IP101GRI PHY
    :figclass: align-center

    RMII Clock from IP101GRI PHY

Please note that the PHY is reset on power up by pulling the RESET_N signal down with a resistor. ESP32 should assert RESET_N high with GPIO5 to enable PHY. Only this can ensure the power-up of system. Otherwise ESP32 may enter download mode (when the clock signal of REF_CLK_50M is at a high logic level during the GPIO0 power-up sampling phase).


RMII Clock Sourced Internally from ESP32's APLL
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Another option is to source the RMII Clock from internal ESP32 APLL, see figure below. The clock signal coming from GPIO0 is first inverted, to account for transmission line delay, and then supplied to the PHY.

.. figure:: ../../../_static/esp32-ethernet-kit-rmii-clk-to-phy.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%
    :alt: RMII Clock from ESP Internal APLL
    :figclass: align-center

    RMII Clock from ESP Internal APLL

To implement this option, users need to remove or add some RC components on the board. For details please refer to `ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.2 Ethernet board (A) schematic`_, sheet 2, location D2. Please note that if the APLL is already used for other purposes (e.g. I2S peripheral), then you have no choice but use an external RMII clock.


GPIO Allocation
---------------

This section describes allocation of ESP32 GPIOs to specific interfaces or functions of the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit.


IP101GRI (PHY) Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The allocation of the ESP32 (MAC) pins to IP101GRI (PHY) is shown in the table below. Implementation of ESP32-Ethernet-Kit defaults to Reduced Media-Independent Interface (RMII).

====  ================  ===============
No.   ESP32 Pin (MAC)   IP101GRI (PHY)
====  ================  ===============
*RMII Interface*
---------------------------------------

10    GPIO5             Reset_N
====  ================  ===============

.. note::

    The allocation of all pins under the ESP32's *RMII Interface* is fixed and cannot be changed either through IO MUX or GPIO Matrix. REF_CLK can only be selected from GPIO0, GPIO16 or GPIO17 and it can not be changed through GPIO Matrix. 


GPIO Header 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This header exposes some GPIOs that are not used elsewhere on the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit.

====  ================
No.   ESP32 Pin
====  ================
 1    GPIO32
 2    GPIO33
 3    GPIO34
 4    GPIO35
 5    GPIO36
 6    GPIO39
====  ================


GPIO Header 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This header contains GPIOs that may be used for other purposes depending on scenarios described in column "Comments".

====  ==========  ====================
No.   ESP32 Pin   Comments
====  ==========  ====================
 1    GPIO17      See note 1
 2    GPIO16      See note 1
 3    GPIO4
 4    GPIO2
 5    GPIO13      See note 2
 6    GPIO12      See note 2
 7    GPIO15      See note 2
 8    GPIO14      See note 2
 9    GND         Ground
10    3V3         3.3 V power supply
====  ==========  ====================

.. note::

    1. The ESP32 pins GPIO16 and GPIO17 are not broken out to the ESP32-WROVER-E module and therefore not available for use. If you need to use these pins, please solder a module without PSRAM memory inside, e.g. the ESP32-WROOM-32D or ESP32-SOLO-1.

    2. Functionality depends on the settings of the `Function Switch`_.

.. note::

    1. To prevent the power-on state of the GPIO0 from being affected by the clock output on the PHY side, the RESET_N signal to PHY defaults to low, turning the clock output off. After power-on you can control RESET_N with GPIO5 to turn the clock output on. See also `RMII Clock Sourced Externally by PHY`_. For PHYs that cannot turn off the clock output through RESET_N, it is recommended to use a crystal module that can be disabled/enabled externally. Similarly like when using RESET_N, the oscillator module should be disabled by default and turned on by ESP32 after power-up. For a reference design please see `ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.2 Ethernet board (A) schematic`_.

    2. The ESP32 pins GPIO16 and GPIO17 are not broken out to the ESP32-WROVER-E module and therefore not available for use. If you need to use these pins, please solder a module without PSRAM memory inside, e.g. the ESP32-WROOM-32D or ESP32-SOLO-1.


Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up your ESP32-Ethernet-Kit, please make sure that the board is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.


Initial Setup
