Modules
=======

This is a family of ESP32-based modules with some integrated key components, including a crystal oscillator and an antenna matching circuit. The modules constitute ready-made solutions for integration into final products. If combined with a few extra components, such as a programming interface, bootstrapping resistors, and pin headers, these modules can also be used for evaluation of ESP32's functionality.

The key characteristics of these modules are summarized in the table below. Some additional details are covered in the following sections.

Development Boards
==================

Depending on the intended functionality, different development boards feature:

- Access to different ESP32 GPIO pins.
- Different interfaces: USB, JTAG.
- Different peripherals: touchpads, LCD screens, SD card slots, female headers for camera modules, etc.

.. _esp-modules-and-boards-esp32-pico-kit:

ESP32-PICO-KIT V4.1
-------------------

This is the smallest available ESP32-based development board. It features all the components for direct connection to a computer's USB port as well as pin headers for plugging into a mini breadboard.

The board is equipped with the `ESP32-PICO-D4`_ module. With such a module, the creation of a fully functional development board required only a few external components that fit on a PCB as small as 20 x 52 mm. The external components include antenna, LDO, USB-UART bridge, and two buttons for reset and activation of Firmware Download mode.
