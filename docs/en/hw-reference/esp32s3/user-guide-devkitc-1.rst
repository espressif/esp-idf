ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 v1.1
========================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

The older version: :doc:`user-guide-devkitc-1-v1.0`

This user guide will help you get started with ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 and will also provide more in-depth information.

The ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 is an entry-level development board equipped with ESP32-S3-WROOM-1, ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U, or ESP32-S3-WROOM-2, a general-purpose Wi-Fi + Bluetooth® LE MCU module that integrates complete Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE functions.

Most of the I/O pins on the module are broken out to the pin headers on both sides of this board for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 on a breadboard.

Getting Started
===============

This section provides a brief introduction of ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1, instructions on how to do the initial hardware setup and how to flash firmware onto it.


Description of Components
-------------------------

The key components of the board are described in a counter-clockwise direction.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key Component
     - Description
   * - ESP32-S3-WROOM-1/1U/2
     - ESP32-S3-WROOM-1, ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U, and ESP32-S3-WROOM-2 are powerful, generic Wi-Fi + Bluetooth LE MCU modules that have a rich set of peripherals. They provide acceleration for neural network computing and signal processing workloads. ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 and ESP32-S3-WROOM-2 comes with a PCB antenna. ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U comes with an external antenna connector.
   * - 5 V to 3.3 V LDO
     - Power regulator that converts a 5 V supply into a 3.3 V output.
   * - Pin Headers
     - All available GPIO pins (except for the SPI bus for flash) are broken out to the pin headers on the board for easy interfacing and programming. For details, please see :ref:`user-guide-s3-devkitc-1-v1.1-header-blocks`.
   * - USB-to-UART Port
     - A Micro-USB port used for power supply to the board, for flashing applications to the chip, as well as for communication with the chip via the on-board USB-to-UART bridge.
   * - Boot Button
     - Download button. Holding down **Boot** and then pressing **Reset** initiates Firmware Download mode for downloading firmware through the serial port.
   * - Reset Button
     - Press this button to restart the system.
   * - ESP32-S3 USB Port
     - ESP32-S3 full-speed USB OTG interface, compliant with the USB 1.1 specification. The interface is used for power supply to the board, for flashing applications to the chip, for communication with the chip using USB 1.1 protocols, as well as for JTAG debugging.
   * - USB-to-UART Bridge
     - Single USB-to-UART bridge chip provides transfer rates up to 3 Mbps.
   * - RGB LED
     - Addressable RGB LED, driven by GPIO38.
   * - 3.3 V Power On LED
     - Turns on when the USB power is connected to the board.

.. note::

    For boards with ESP32-S3-WROOM-2 modules, the pins GPIO35, GPIO36 and GPIO37 are used for the internal communication between ESP32-S3 and SPI flash/PSRAM memory, thus not available for external use.


Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up your board, please make sure that it is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.


Required Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1
- USB 2.0 cable (Standard-A to Micro-B)
- Computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS

.. note::

  Be sure to use an appropriate USB cable. Some cables are for charging only and do not provide the needed data lines nor work for programming the boards.


Hardware Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connect the board with the computer using **USB-to-UART Port**. Connection using **ESP32-S3 USB Port** is not fully implemented in software. In subsequent steps, **USB-to-UART Port** will be used by default.


Software Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please proceed to :doc:`../../get-started/index`, where Section :ref:`get-started-step-by-step` will quickly help you set up the development environment and then flash an application example onto your board.


Contents and Packaging
