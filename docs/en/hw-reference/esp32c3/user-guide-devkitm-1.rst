:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

This user guide will help you get started with ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 and will also provide more in-depth information.

ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 is an entry-level development board based on `ESP32-C3-MINI-1 <https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c3-mini-1_datasheet_en.pdf>`_, a module named for its small size. This board integrates complete Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE functions.

Most of the I/O pins on the ESP32-C3-MINI-1 module are broken out to the pin headers on both sides of this board for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 on a breadboard.

   * - Key Component
     - Description
   * - ESP32-C3-MINI-1
     - ESP32-C3-MINI-1 is a general-purpose Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE combo module that comes with a PCB antenna. At the core of this module is `ESP32-C3FN4 <https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c3_datasheet_en.pdf>`_, a chip that has an embedded flash of 4 MB. Since flash is packaged in the ESP32-C3FN4 chip, rather than integrated into the module, ESP32-C3-MINI-1 has a smaller package size.
   * - 5 V to 3.3 V LDO
     - Power regulator that converts a 5 V supply into a 3.3 V output.
   * - 5 V Power On LED
     - Turns on when the USB power is connected to the board.
   * - Pin Headers
     - All available GPIO pins (except for the SPI bus for flash) are broken out to the pin headers on the board. For details, please see :ref:`user-guide-c3-devkitm-1-v1-header-blocks`.
   * - Boot Button
     - Download button. Holding down **Boot** and then pressing **Reset** initiates Firmware Download mode for downloading firmware through the serial port.
   * - Micro-USB Port
     - USB interface. Power supply for the board as well as the communication interface between a computer and the ESP32-C3FN4 chip.
   * - Reset Button
     - Press this button to restart the system.
   * - USB-to-UART Bridge
     - Single USB-UART bridge chip provides transfer rates up to 3 Mbps.
   * - RGB LED
     - Addressable RGB LED, driven by GPIO8.


Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up your ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1, please make sure that it is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.

Required Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1
- USB 2.0 cable (Standard-A to Micro-B)
- Computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS

.. note::

  Be sure to use an appropriate USB cable. Some cables are for charging only and do not provide the needed data lines nor work for programming the boards.

Software Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please proceed to :doc:`../../get-started/index`, where Section :ref:`get-started-step-by-step` will quickly help you set up the development environment and then flash an application example onto your ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1.

Contents and Packaging
----------------------

Retail Orders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you order one or several samples, each ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 comes in an individual package in either antistatic bag or any packaging depending on your retailer.

For retail orders, please go to https://www.espressif.com/en/contact-us/get-samples.


Wholesale Orders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you order in bulk, the boards come in large cardboard boxes.

For wholesale orders, please go to https://www.espressif.com/en/contact-us/sales-questions.

Power Supply Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board:

- Micro-USB Port, default power supply
- 5V and GND pin headers
- 3V3 and GND pin headers

It is recommended to use the first option: Micro-USB Port.

.. [1] P: Power supply; I: Input; O: Output; T: High impedance.
.. [2] GPIO2, GPIO8, and GPIO9 are strapping pins of the ESP32-C3FN4 chip. These pins are used to control several chip functions depending on binary voltage values applied to the pins during chip power-up or system reset. For description and application of the strapping pins, please refer to Section Strapping Pins in `ESP32-C3 Datasheet`_.
