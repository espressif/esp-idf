.. _user-guide-esp32-s2-kaluga-1-kit-ext-board-compatibility:

Compatibility of Extension Boards
---------------------------------

If you want to use more than one extension board at the same time, please check the table given below.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 15 33 32
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Boards Used
     - HW Conflict
     - Limitations
     - Solution
   * - 8311A v1.3 + CAM v1.1
     - I2S Controller
     - ESP32-S2 has only one I2S interface. But both extension boards require connection via the ESP32-S2's I2S interface (LyraT-8311A in Standard mode, ESP-LyraP-CAM in Camera mode).
     - Utilize time division multiple access, or use a different audio module that can be connected via other GPIOs or DAC.
   * - TouchA v1.1 + LCD32 v1.2
     - IO11, IO6
     - Touch actions cannot be triggered because of the multiplexed pin IO11. ESP-LyraP-LCD32 will not be affected because its BLCT pin will be disconnected from IO6.
     - Do not initialize IO11 (NETWORK) for your ESP-LyraP-TouchA, or configure the BLCT pin to `-1` (= do not use BLCT) for your ESP-LyraP-LCD32.
   * - 8311A v1.3 + LCD32 v1.2
     - IO6
     - BLCT pin of ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1 will be disconnected from IO6.
     - Configure the BK pin to `-1` (= do not use BLCT) for your ESP-LyraP-LCD32.
   * - TouchA v1.1 + 8311A v1.3
     - Pin BT_ADC on ESP-LyraT-8311A
     - This pin is required for initialization of the six button on ESP-LyraT-8311A. At the same time, ESP-LyraP-TouchA needs this pin for its touch actions.
     - If you plan to use buttons on ESP-LyraT-8311A, do not initialize pin IO6 (PHOTO) for your ESP-LyraP-TouchA.
   * - TouchA v1.1 + CAM v1.1
     - IO1, IO2, IO3
     - Cannot be used simultaneously because of the mentioned multiplexed pins.
     - For ESP-LyraP-TouchA, do not initialize IO1 (VOL_UP), IO2 (PLAY), and IO3 (VOL_DOWN).
   * - TouchA v1.1 + LCD32 v1.2 + CAM v1.1
     - IO1, IO2, IO3, IO11
     - Conflicts on the mentioned multiplexed pins.
     - For ESP-LyraP-TouchA, do not initialize IO1 (VOL_UP), IO2 (PLAY), IO3 (VOL_DOWN), and IO11 (NETWORK).
   * - TouchA v1.1 + LCD32 v1.2 + 8311A v1.3
     - IO6, IO11
     - If ESP-LyraT-8311A's pin BT_ADC is used to initialize the board's six buttons, IO6 and IO11 will not be available for the other boards.
     - Do not initialize IO11 (NETWORK) for your ESP-LyraP-TouchA. Also, if you need to use BT_ADC, do not initialize IO6 (PHOTO).

Also, all extension boards and the :ref:`JTAG interface <jtag-debugging-tip-jtag-pins-reconfigured>` share the same pins IO39, IO40, IO41 and IO42. For this reason, the following may disturb the JTAG operation:

* Plugging in any extension board
* Debugging an application that is using an extension board


Hardware Revision Details
=========================

ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1 Kit v1.3
--------------------------

* The following pins re-assigned to fix the download issue

  * Camera D2： GPIO36
  * Camera D3： GPIO37
  * AU_I2S1_SDI： GPIO34
  * AU_WAKE_INT： GPIO46

* RGB pin header moved to the board's edge
* All dip switches moved to the flip side for convenient operation
