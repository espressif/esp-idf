Modules
=======

This is a family of ESP32-S2-based modules with some integrated key components, including a crystal oscillator and an antenna matching circuit. The modules constitute ready-made solutions for integration into final products. If combined with a few extra components, such as a programming interface, bootstrapping resistors, and pin headers, these modules can also be used for evaluation of ESP32-S2's functionality.

The key characteristics of these modules are summarized in the table below. Some additional details are covered in the following sections.
