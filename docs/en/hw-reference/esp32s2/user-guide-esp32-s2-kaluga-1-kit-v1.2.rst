- Extension header (ESP-LyraT-8311A, ESP-LyraP-LCD32)
- Camera header (ESP-LyraP-CAM)
- Touch FPC connector (ESP-LyraP-TouchA)
- LCD FPC connector (no official extension boards yet)
- I2C FPC connector (no official extension boards yet)

.. _user-guide-esp32-s2-kaluga-1-kit-v1.2-ext-board-compatibility:

Compatibility of Extension Boards
---------------------------------

If you want to use more than one extension board at the same time, please check the table given below.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 10 30 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Boards Used
     - HW Conflict
     - Limitations
     - Solution
   * - 8311A v1.2 + CAM v1.0
     - I2S Controller, IO46
     - ESP32-S2 has only one I2S interface. But both extension boards require connection via the ESP32-S2's I2S interface (ESP-LyraT-8311A in Standard mode, ESP-LyraP-CAM in Camera mode). If IO46 is used by both extension boards at the same time, ESP-LyraP-CAM experiences interferences when used.
     - No ready solution for now.
   * - TouchA v1.1 + LCD32 v1.1
     - IO11, IO6
     - Touch actions cannot be triggered because of the multiplexed pin IO11. ESP-LyraP-LCD32 is also affected because its BK (BLCT) pin is connected to pin IO6.
     - Do not initialize IO11 (NETWORK) and IO6 (PHOTO) for your ESP-LyraP-TouchA.
   * - 8311A v1.2 + LCD32 v1.1
     - IO6
     - The two extension boards can be used at the same time. However, since the BK (BLCT) pin of ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1 is connected to IO6, ESP-LyraT-8311A's pin BT_ADC cannot be used and the board's six buttons will not be available.
     - There is a solution that will allow you to use ESP-LyraT-8311A's pin BT_ADC, but will stop you from controlling the display background brightness with software: on your ESP-LyraP-LCD32 board, remove R39, change R41 to 100 Ohm, switch BLCT_L to on.
   * - TouchA v1.1 + 8311A v1.2
     - Pin BT_ADC on ESP-LyraT-8311A
     - The two extension boards can be used at the same time. However, ESP-LyraP-TouchA cannot be triggered if ESP-LyraT-8311A's pin BT_ADC is used to initialize the board's six buttons.
     - If you plan to use ESP-LyraT-8311A's pin BT_ADC, do not initialize pin IO6 (PHOTO) for your ESP-LyraP-TouchA.
   * - TouchA v1.1 + CAM v1.0
     - IO1, IO2, IO3
     - Cannot be used simultaneously because of the mentioned multiplexed pins.
     - For ESP-LyraP-TouchA, do not initialize IO1 (VOL_UP), IO2 (PLAY), and IO3 (VOL_DOWN).
   * - TouchA v1.1 + LCD32 v1.1 + CAM v1.0
     - IO1, IO2, IO3, IO6, IO11
     - Conflicts on the mentioned multiplexed pins.
     - **Solution 1**: For ESP-LyraP-TouchA, do not initialize IO1 (VOL_UP), IO2 (PLAY), IO3 (VOL_DOWN), IO6 (PHOTO) and IO11 (NETWORK). **Solution 2**: It will allow you to initialize IO6 (PHOTO) properly, but will stop you from controlling the background brightness with software. On your ESP-LyraP-LCD32, remove R39, change R41 to 100 Ohm, switch BLCT_L to on.
   * - TouchA v1.1 + LCD32 v1.1 + 8311A v1.2
     - IO6, IO11
     - IO11 is multiplexed; IO6 is also multiplexed stopping you from using ESP-LyraT-8311A's pin BT_ADC that is needed to initialize the board's six buttons.
     - **Solution 1**: For ESP-LyraP-TouchA, do not initialize IO6 (PHOTO) and IO11 (NETWORK). Please note that the six buttons on ESP-LyraT-8311A still cannot be used. **Solution 2**: On your ESP-LyraP-LCD32, remove R39, change R41 to 100 Ohm, switch BLCT_L to on. For your ESP-LyraP-TouchA, do not initialize IO11 (NETWORK). If you want to use the six buttons on your ESP-LyraT-8311A, also do not initialize IO6 (PHOTO).

Also, all extension boards and the :ref:`JTAG interface <jtag-debugging-tip-jtag-pins-reconfigured>` share the same pins IO39, IO40, IO41 and IO42. For this reason, the following may disturb the JTAG operation:

* Plugging in any extension board
* Debugging an application that is using an extension board


Known issues
============
