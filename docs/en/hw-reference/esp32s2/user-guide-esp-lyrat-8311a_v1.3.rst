====================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

This user guide provides information on the ESP-LyraT-8311A extension board.

This board cannot be bought separately and is usually sold together with other Espressif development boards (e.g., ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1), which will be referred to as *main boards* below.

Currently, ESP-LyraT-8311A v1.3 is sold as part of the :doc:`user-guide-esp32-s2-kaluga-1-kit`.

The ESP-LyraT-8311A extends the functionality of your main board by adding sound processing functionality:

- Audio playback/recording
- Processing of audio signals
- Programmable buttons for easy control

This extension board can be used in many ways. The applications might include voice user interface, voice control, voice authorization, recording and playback of sound, etc.

Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up your ESP-LyraT-8311A, please make sure that it is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.


Required Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Board with a female Extension Header (e.g., ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1)
- ESP-LyraT-8311A extension board
- Four mounting bolts (for stable mounting)
- Computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS


Hardware Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To mount your ESP-LyraT-8311A onto the board with a female Extension Header:

1. Install the four mounting bolts onto the board with a female Extension Header
2. Align the ESP-LyraT-8311A with the bolts and Extension Header and insert it carefully


Software Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on your application, see:

* `ESP-ADF Getting Started Guide <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-adf/en/latest/get-started/index.html#about-esp-adf>`_ if you develop with ESP-ADF (Espressif Audio Development Framework).
* Section :ref:`user-guide-esp32-s2-kaluga-1-kit-software-setup` of the ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1 kit user guide if you develop directly with ESP-IDF (Espressif IOT Development Framework).
