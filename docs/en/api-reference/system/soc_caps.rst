SoC Capabilities
================

This section lists definitions of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}'s SoC hardware capabilities. These definitions are commonly used in IDF to control which hardware dependent features are supported and thus compiled into the binary.

.. note::

    These defines are currently not considered to be part of the public API, and may be changed at any time.
