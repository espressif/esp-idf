.. only:: esp32 or esp32c3 or esp32s3

    Application Examples
    --------------------

    .. only:: esp32

        - :example:`bluetooth/hci/ble_adv_scan_combined` demonstrates how to use Bluetooth capabilities for advertising and scanning with a virtual Host Controller Interface (HCI). This example shows how to implement some host functionalities without a host and displays scanned advertising reports from other devices.

        - :example:`bluetooth/hci/controller_hci_uart_esp32` demonstrates how to configure the Bluetooth LE Controller's HCI to communicate over UART on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, enabling communication with an external Bluetooth host stack.

        - :example:`bluetooth/hci/controller_vhci_ble_adv` demonstrates how to use the ESP-IDF VHCI ble_advertising app to perform advertising without a host and display received HCI events from the controller.

    .. only:: esp32c3 or esp32s3

        - :example:`bluetooth/hci/controller_hci_uart_esp32c3_and_esp32s3` demonstrates how to configure the Bluetooth LE Controller's HCI to communicate over UART on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, enabling communication with an external Bluetooth host stack.
