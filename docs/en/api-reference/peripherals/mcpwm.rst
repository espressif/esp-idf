Motor Control Pulse Width Modulator (MCPWM)
===========================================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`


The MCPWM peripheral is a versatile PWM generator, which contains various submodules to make it a key element in power electronic applications like motor control, digital power, and so on. Typically, the MCPWM peripheral can be used in the following scenarios:

- Digital motor control, e.g., brushed/brushless DC motor, RC servo motor
- Switch mode-based digital power conversion
- Power DAC, where the duty cycle is equivalent to a DAC analog value
- Calculate external pulse width, and convert it into other analog values like speed, distance
- Generate Space Vector PWM (SVPWM) signals for Field Oriented Control (FOC)

The main submodules are listed in the following diagram:

.. blockdiag:: /../_static/diagrams/mcpwm/mcpwm_overview.diag
    :caption: MCPWM Overview
    :align: center

- **MCPWM Timer**: The time base of the final PWM signal. It also determines the event timing of other submodules.
- **MCPWM Operator**: The key module that is responsible for generating the PWM waveforms. It consists of other submodules, like comparator, PWM generator, dead time, and carrier modulator.
- **MCPWM Comparator**: The compare module takes the time-base count value as input, and continuously compares it to the threshold value configured. When the timer is equal to any of the threshold values, a compare event will be generated and the MCPWM generator can update its level accordingly.
- **MCPWM Generator**: One MCPWM generator can generate a pair of PWM waves, complementarily or independently, based on various events triggered by other submodules like MCPWM Timer and MCPWM Comparator.
- **MCPWM Fault**: The fault module is used to detect the fault condition from outside, mainly via the GPIO matrix. Once the fault signal is active, MCPWM Operator will force all the generators into a predefined state to protect the system from damage.
- **MCPWM Sync**: The sync module is used to synchronize the MCPWM timers, so that the final PWM signals generated by different MCPWM generators can have a fixed phase difference. The sync signal can be routed from the GPIO matrix or from an MCPWM Timer event.
- **Dead Time**: This submodule is used to insert extra delay to the existing PWM edges generated in the previous steps.
- **Carrier Modulation**: The carrier submodule can modulate a high-frequency carrier signal into PWM waveforms by the generator and dead time submodules. This capability is mandatory for controlling the power-switching elements.
- **Brake**: MCPWM operator can set how to brake the generators when a particular fault is detected. You can shut down the PWM output immediately or regulate the PWM output cycle by cycle, depending on how critical the fault is.
- **MCPWM Capture**: This is a standalone submodule that can work even without the above MCPWM operators. The capture consists one dedicated timer and several independent channels, with each channel connected to the GPIO. A pulse on the GPIO triggers the capture timer to store the time-base count value and then notify you by an interrupt. Using this feature, you can measure a pulse width precisely. What is more, the capture timer can also be synchronized by the MCPWM Sync submodule.

Resource Allocation and Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As displayed in the diagram above, the MCPWM peripheral consists of several submodules. Each submodule has its own resource allocation, which is described in the following sections.

MCPWM Timers
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can allocate a MCPWM timer object by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_timer` function, with a configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_config_t` as the parameter. The configuration structure is defined as:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::group_id` specifies the MCPWM group ID. The ID should belong to [0, :c:macro:`SOC_MCPWM_GROUPS` - 1] range. Please note, timers located in different groups are totally independent.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::intr_priority` sets the priority of the interrupt. If it is set to ``0``, the driver will allocate an interrupt with a default priority. Otherwise, the driver will use the given priority.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::clk_src` sets the clock source of the timer.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::resolution_hz` sets the expected resolution of the timer. The driver internally sets a proper divider based on the clock source and the resolution.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::count_mode` sets the count mode of the timer.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::period_ticks` sets the period of the timer, in ticks (the tick resolution is set in the :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::resolution_hz`).
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::update_period_on_empty` sets whether to update the period value when the timer counts to zero.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::update_period_on_sync` sets whether to update the period value when the timer takes a sync signal.

The :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_timer` will return a pointer to the allocated timer object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there are no more free timers in the MCPWM group, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. [1]_

On the contrary, calling the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_del_timer` function will free the allocated timer object.

.. note::

    The prescale for the MCPWM group will be calculated with the resolution of the first timer, and the driver will find the appropriate prescale from low to high. If there is a prescale conflict when allocating multiple timers, allocate timers in order of their target resolution, either from highest to lowest or lowest to highest. For more information, please refer to :ref:`mcpwm-resolution-config`.

MCPWM Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can allocate a MCPWM operator object by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_operator` function, with a configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_operator_config_t` as the parameter. The configuration structure is defined as:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_operator_config_t::group_id` specifies the MCPWM group ID. The ID should belong to [0, :c:macro:`SOC_MCPWM_GROUPS` - 1] range. Please note, operators located in different groups are totally independent.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_operator_config_t::intr_priority` sets the priority of the interrupt. If it is set to ``0``, the driver will allocate an interrupt with a default priority. Otherwise, the driver will use the given priority.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_operator_config_t::update_gen_action_on_tez` sets whether to update the generator action when the timer counts to zero. Here and below, the timer refers to the one that is connected to the operator by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_connect_timer`.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_operator_config_t::update_gen_action_on_tep` sets whether to update the generator action when the timer counts to peak.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_operator_config_t::update_gen_action_on_sync` sets whether to update the generator action when the timer takes a sync signal.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_operator_config_t::update_dead_time_on_tez` sets whether to update the dead time when the timer counts to zero.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_operator_config_t::update_dead_time_on_tep` sets whether to update the dead time when the timer counts to the peak.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_operator_config_t::update_dead_time_on_sync` sets whether to update the dead time when the timer takes a sync signal.

The :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_operator` will return a pointer to the allocated operator object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there are no more free operators in the MCPWM group, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. [1]_

On the contrary, calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_del_operator` function will free the allocated operator object.

MCPWM Comparators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can allocate a MCPWM comparator object by calling the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_comparator` function, with a MCPWM operator handle and configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_comparator_config_t` as the parameter. The operator handle is created by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_operator`. The configuration structure is defined as:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_comparator_config_t::intr_priority` sets the priority of the interrupt. If it is set to ``0``, the driver will allocate an interrupt with a default priority. Otherwise, the driver will use the given priority.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_comparator_config_t::update_cmp_on_tez` sets whether to update the compare threshold when the timer counts to zero.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_comparator_config_t::update_cmp_on_tep` sets whether to update the compare threshold when the timer counts to the peak.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_comparator_config_t::update_cmp_on_sync` sets whether to update the compare threshold when the timer takes a sync signal.

The :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_comparator` will return a pointer to the allocated comparator object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there are no more free comparators in the MCPWM operator, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. [1]_

On the contrary, calling the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_del_comparator` function will free the allocated comparator object.

.. only:: SOC_MCPWM_SUPPORT_EVENT_COMPARATOR and SOC_MCPWM_SUPPORT_ETM

    There's another kind of comparator called "Event Comparator", which **can not** control the final PWM directly but only generates the ETM events at a configurable time stamp. You can allocate an event comparator by calling the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_event_comparator` function. This function will return the same handle type as :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_comparator`, but with a different configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_event_comparator_config_t`. For more information, please refer to :ref:`mcpwm-etm-event-and-task`.

MCPWM Generators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can allocate a MCPWM generator object by calling the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_generator` function, with a MCPWM operator handle and configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_generator_config_t` as the parameter. The operator handle is created by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_operator`. The configuration structure is defined as:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_generator_config_t::gen_gpio_num` sets the GPIO number used by the generator.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_generator_config_t::invert_pwm` sets whether to invert the PWM signal.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_generator_config_t::pull_up` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_generator_config_t::pull_down` controls whether to enable the internal pull-up and pull-down resistors accordingly.

The :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_generator` will return a pointer to the allocated generator object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there are no more free generators in the MCPWM operator, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. [1]_

On the contrary, calling the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_del_generator` function will free the allocated generator object.

MCPWM Faults
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two types of faults: A fault signal reflected from the GPIO and a fault generated by software.

To allocate a GPIO fault object, you can call the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_gpio_fault` function, with the configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gpio_fault_config_t` as the parameter. The configuration structure is defined as:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gpio_fault_config_t::group_id` sets the MCPWM group ID. The ID should belong to [0, :c:macro:`SOC_MCPWM_GROUPS` - 1] range. Please note, GPIO faults located in different groups are totally independent, i.e., GPIO faults in group 0 can not be detected by the operator in group 1.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gpio_fault_config_t::intr_priority` sets the priority of the interrupt. If it is set to ``0``, the driver will allocate an interrupt with a default priority. Otherwise, the driver will use the given priority.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gpio_fault_config_t::gpio_num` sets the GPIO number used by the fault.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gpio_fault_config_t::active_level` sets the active level of the fault signal.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gpio_fault_config_t::pull_up` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gpio_fault_config_t::pull_down` set whether to pull up and/or pull down the GPIO internally.

The :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_gpio_fault` will return a pointer to the allocated fault object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there are no more free GPIO faults in the MCPWM group, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. [1]_

Software fault object can be used to trigger a fault by calling the function :cpp:func:`mcpwm_soft_fault_activate` instead of waiting for a real fault signal on the GPIO. A software fault object can be allocated by calling the  :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_soft_fault` function, with configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_soft_fault_config_t` as the parameter. Currently, this configuration structure is left for future purposes.

The :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_soft_fault` function will return a pointer to the allocated fault object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there is no memory left for the fault object, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NO_MEM` error. Although the software fault and GPIO fault are of different types, the returned fault handle is of the same type.

On the contrary, calling the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_del_fault` function will free the allocated fault object, this function works for both software and GPIO fault.

MCPWM Sync Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sync source is what can be used to synchronize the MCPWM timer and MCPWM capture timer. There are three types of sync sources: a sync source reflected from the GPIO, a sync source generated by software, and a sync source generated by an MCPWM timer event.

To allocate a GPIO sync source, you can call the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_gpio_sync_src` function, with configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gpio_sync_src_config_t` as the parameter. The configuration structure is defined as:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gpio_sync_src_config_t::group_id` sets the MCPWM group ID. The ID should belong to [0, :c:macro:`SOC_MCPWM_GROUPS` - 1] range. Please note, the GPIO sync sources located in different groups are totally independent, i.e., GPIO sync source in group 0 can not be detected by the timers in group 1.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gpio_sync_src_config_t::gpio_num` sets the GPIO number used by the sync source.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gpio_sync_src_config_t::active_neg` sets whether the sync signal is active on falling edges.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gpio_sync_src_config_t::pull_up` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gpio_sync_src_config_t::pull_down` set whether to pull up and/or pull down the GPIO internally.

The :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_gpio_sync_src` will return a pointer to the allocated sync source object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there are no more free GPIO sync sources in the MCPWM group, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. [1]_

To allocate a timer event sync source, you can call the  :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_timer_sync_src` function, with configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_sync_src_config_t` as the parameter. The configuration structure is defined as:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_src_config_t::timer_event` specifies on what timer event to generate the sync signal.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_src_config_t::propagate_input_sync` sets whether to propagate the input sync signal (i.e., the input sync signal will be routed to its sync output).

The :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_timer_sync_src` will return a pointer to the allocated sync source object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, if a sync source has been allocated from the same timer before, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` error.

Last but not least, to allocate a software sync source, you can call the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_soft_sync_src` function, with configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_soft_sync_config_t` as the parameter. Currently, this configuration structure is left for future purposes.

:cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_soft_sync_src` will return a pointer to the allocated sync source object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there is no memory left for the sync source object, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NO_MEM` error. Please note, to make a software sync source take effect, do not forget to call :cpp:func:`mcpwm_soft_sync_activate`.

On the contrary, calling the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_del_sync_src` function will free the allocated sync source object. This function works for all types of sync sources.

MCPWM Capture Timer and Channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCPWM group has a dedicated timer which is used to capture the timestamp when a specific event occurred. The capture timer is connected to several independent channels, each channel is assigned a GPIO.

To allocate a capture timer, you can call the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_capture_timer` function, with configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_timer_config_t` as the parameter. The configuration structure is defined as:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_config_t::group_id` sets the MCPWM group ID. The ID should belong to [0, :c:macro:`SOC_MCPWM_GROUPS` - 1] range.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_config_t::clk_src` sets the clock source of the capture timer.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_config_t::resolution_hz` The driver internally will set a proper divider based on the clock source and the resolution. If it is set to ``0``, the driver will pick an appropriate resolution on its own, and you can subsequently view the current timer resolution via :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_get_resolution`.

.. only:: not SOC_MCPWM_CAPTURE_CLK_FROM_GROUP

    .. note::

        In {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_config_t::resolution_hz` parameter is invalid, the capture timer resolution is always equal to the :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_CAPTURE_CLK_SRC_APB`.

.. only:: SOC_MCPWM_CAPTURE_CLK_FROM_GROUP

    .. note::

        Timers and capture timers share the MCPWM group clock source. The prescale for the MCPWM group will be calculated with the resolution of the first allocated (capture)timer. The driver will search for the appropriate prescale from low to high. If there is a prescale conflict when allocating multiple (capture)timers, allocate (capture)timers in order of their target resolution, either from highest to lowest or lowest to highest. For more information, please refer to :ref:`mcpwm-resolution-config`.

The :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_capture_timer` will return a pointer to the allocated capture timer object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there is no free capture timer left in the MCPWM group, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. [1]_

Next, to allocate a capture channel, you can call the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_capture_channel` function, with a capture timer handle and configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t` as the parameter. The configuration structure is defined as:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::intr_priority` sets the priority of the interrupt. If it is set to ``0``, the driver will allocate an interrupt with a default priority. Otherwise, the driver will use the given priority.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::gpio_num` sets the GPIO number used by the capture channel.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::prescale` sets the prescaler of the input signal.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::extra_capture_channel_flags::pos_edge` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::extra_capture_channel_flags::neg_edge` set whether to capture on the positive and/or falling edge of the input signal.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::extra_capture_channel_flags::pull_up` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::extra_capture_channel_flags::pull_down` set whether to pull up and/or pull down the GPIO internally.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::extra_capture_channel_flags::invert_cap_signal` sets whether to invert the capture signal.

The :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_capture_channel` will return a pointer to the allocated capture channel object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there is no free capture channel left in the capture timer, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error.

On the contrary, calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_del_capture_channel` and :cpp:func:`mcpwm_del_capture_timer` will free the allocated capture channel and timer object accordingly.

MCPWM Interrupt Priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MCPWM allows configuring interrupts separately for timer, operator, comparator, fault, and capture events. The interrupt priority is determined by the respective ``config_t::intr_priority``. Additionally, events within the same MCPWM group share a common interrupt source. When registering multiple interrupt events, the interrupt priorities need to remain consistent.

.. note::

    When registering multiple interrupt events within an MCPWM group, the driver will use the interrupt priority of the first registered event as the MCPWM group's interrupt priority.


.. _mcpwm-timer-operations-and-events:

Timer Operations and Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update Period
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The timer period is initialized by the :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::period_ticks` parameter in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_config_t`. You can update the period at runtime by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_set_period` function. The new period will take effect based on how you set the :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::update_period_on_empty` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::update_period_on_sync` parameters in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_config_t`. If none of them are set, the timer period will take effect immediately.

Register Timer Event Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCPWM timer can generate different events at runtime. If you have some function that should be called when a particular event happens, you should hook your function to the interrupt service routine by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_register_event_callbacks`. The callback function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_event_cb_t`. All supported event callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_event_callbacks_t`:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_event_callbacks_t::on_full` sets the callback function for the timer when it counts to peak value.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_event_callbacks_t::on_empty` sets the callback function for the timer when it counts to zero.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_event_callbacks_t::on_stop` sets the callback function for the timer when it is stopped.

The callback functions above are called within the ISR context, so they should **not** attempt to block. For example, you may make sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the ``ISR`` suffix are called within the function.

The parameter ``user_data`` of the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_register_event_callbacks` function is used to save your own context. It is passed to each callback function directly.

This function will lazy the install interrupt service for the MCPWM timer without enabling it. It is only allowed to be called before :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_enable`, otherwise the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` error will be returned. See also `Enable and Disable timer <#enable-and-disable-timer>`__ for more information.

Enable and Disable Timer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before doing IO control to the timer, you need to enable the timer first, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_enable`.  This function:

* switches the timer state from **init** to **enable**.
* enables the interrupt service if it has been lazy installed by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_register_event_callbacks`.
* acquire a proper power management lock if a specific clock source (e.g., PLL_160M clock) is selected. See also `Power management <#power-management>`__ for more information.

On the contrary, calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_disable` will put the timer driver back to the **init** state, disable the interrupt service and release the power management lock.

Start and Stop Timer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic IO operation of a timer is to start and stop. Calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_start_stop` with different :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_start_stop_cmd_t` commands can start the timer immediately or stop the timer at a specific event. What is more, you can even start the timer for only one round, which means, the timer will count to peak value or zero, and then stop itself.

Connect Timer with Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The allocated MCPWM timer should be connected with an MCPWM operator by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_connect_timer`, so that the operator can take that timer as its time base, and generate the required PWM waves. Please make sure the MCPWM timer and operator are in the same group. Otherwise, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG` error.


.. _mcpwm-comparator-operations-and-events:

Comparator Operations and Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Register Comparator Event Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCPWM comparator can inform you when the timer counter equals the compare value. If you have some function that should be called when this event happens, you should hook your function to the interrupt service routine by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_register_event_callbacks`. The callback function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_compare_event_cb_t`. All supported event callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_comparator_event_callbacks_t`:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_comparator_event_callbacks_t::on_reach` sets the callback function for the comparator when the timer counter equals the compare value.

The callback function provides event-specific data of type :cpp:type:`mcpwm_compare_event_data_t` to you. The callback function is called within the ISR context, so it should **not** attempt to block. For example, you may make sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the ``ISR`` suffix are called within the function.

The parameter ``user_data`` of :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_register_event_callbacks` function is used to save your own context. It is passed to the callback function directly.

This function will lazy the installation of interrupt service for the MCPWM comparator, whereas the service can only be removed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_del_comparator`.

.. only:: SOC_MCPWM_SUPPORT_EVENT_COMPARATOR

    .. note::

        It is not supported to register event callbacks for an **Event Comparator** because it can not generate any interrupt.

Set Compare Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set the compare value for the MCPWM comparator at runtime by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_set_compare_value`. There are a few points to note:

- A new compare value might not take effect immediately. The update time for the compare value is set by :cpp:member:`mcpwm_comparator_config_t::update_cmp_on_tez` or :cpp:member:`mcpwm_comparator_config_t::update_cmp_on_tep` or :cpp:member:`mcpwm_comparator_config_t::update_cmp_on_sync`.
- Make sure the operator has connected to one MCPWM timer already by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_connect_timer`. Otherwise, it will return the error code :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`.
- The compare value should not exceed the timer's count peak, otherwise, the compare event will never get triggered.

One generator can set multiple actions on different timer events, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_timer_event` with a variable number of action configurations. The action configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gen_timer_event_action_t`:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_timer_event_action_t::direction` specifies the timer direction. The supported directions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_direction_t`.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_timer_event_action_t::event` specifies the timer event. The supported timer events are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_event_t`.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_timer_event_action_t::action` specifies the generator action to be taken. The supported actions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_generator_action_t`.

There is a helper macro :c:macro:`MCPWM_GEN_TIMER_EVENT_ACTION` to simplify the construction of a timer event action entry.

Please note, the argument list of :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_timer_event` **must** be terminated by :c:macro:`MCPWM_GEN_TIMER_EVENT_ACTION_END`.

You can also set the timer action one by one by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_action_on_timer_event` without varargs.

Set Generator Action on Compare Event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One generator can set multiple actions on different compare events, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_compare_event` with a variable number of action configurations. The action configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gen_compare_event_action_t`:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_compare_event_action_t::direction` specifies the timer direction. The supported directions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_direction_t`.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_compare_event_action_t::comparator` specifies the comparator handle. See `MCPWM Comparators <#mcpwm-comparators>`__ for how to allocate a comparator.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_compare_event_action_t::action` specifies the generator action to be taken. The supported actions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_generator_action_t`.

There is a helper macro :c:macro:`MCPWM_GEN_COMPARE_EVENT_ACTION` to simplify the construction of a compare event action entry.

Please note, the argument list of :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_compare_event` **must** be terminated by :c:macro:`MCPWM_GEN_COMPARE_EVENT_ACTION_END`.

You can also set the compare action one by one by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_action_on_compare_event` without varargs.

Set Generator Action on Fault Event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One generator can set action on fault based trigger events, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_action_on_fault_event` with an action configurations. The action configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gen_fault_event_action_t`:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_fault_event_action_t::direction` specifies the timer direction. The supported directions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_direction_t`.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_fault_event_action_t::fault` specifies the fault used for the trigger. See `MCPWM Faults <#mcpwm-faults>`__ for how to allocate a fault.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_fault_event_action_t::action` specifies the generator action to be taken. The supported actions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_generator_action_t`.

When no free trigger slot is left in the operator to which the generator belongs, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. [1]_

The trigger only support GPIO fault. when the input is not a GPIO fault, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` error.

There is a helper macro :c:macro:`MCPWM_GEN_FAULT_EVENT_ACTION` to simplify the construction of a trigger event action entry.

Please note, fault event does not have variadic function like :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_fault_event`.

Set Generator Action on Sync Event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One generator can set action on sync based trigger events, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_action_on_sync_event` with an action configurations. The action configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gen_sync_event_action_t`:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_sync_event_action_t::direction` specifies the timer direction. The supported directions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_direction_t`.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_sync_event_action_t::sync` specifies the sync source used for the trigger. See `MCPWM Sync Sources  <#mcpwm-sync-sources>`__ for how to allocate a sync source.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_sync_event_action_t::action` specifies the generator action to be taken. The supported actions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_generator_action_t`.

When no free trigger slot is left in the operator to which the generator belongs, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. [1]_

The trigger only support one sync action, regardless of the kinds. When set sync actions more than once, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` error.

There is a helper macro :c:macro:`MCPWM_GEN_SYNC_EVENT_ACTION` to simplify the construction of a trigger event action entry.

Please note, sync event does not have variadic function like :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_sync_event`.

Generator Configurations for Classical PWM Waveforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section will demonstrate the classical PWM waveforms that can be generated by the pair of generators. The code snippet that is used to generate the waveforms is also provided below the diagram. Some general summary:

- The **Symmetric** or **Asymmetric** of the waveforms is determined by the count mode of the MCPWM timer.
- The **active level** of the waveform pair is determined by the level of the PWM with a smaller duty cycle.
- The period of the PWM waveform is determined by the timer's period and count mode.
- The duty cycle of the PWM waveform is determined by the generator's various action combinations.

.. _mcpwm-dead-time:

Dead Time
^^^^^^^^^

In power electronics, the rectifier and inverter are commonly used. This requires the use of a rectifier bridge and an inverter bridge. Each bridge arm has two power electronic devices, such as MOSFET, IGBT, etc. The two MOSFETs on the same arm can not conduct at the same time, otherwise there will be a short circuit. The fact is that, although the PWM wave shows it is turning off the switch, the MOSFET still needs a small time window to make that happen. This requires an extra delay to be added to the existing PWM wave generated by setting `Generator Actions on Events <#generator-actions-on-events>`__.

The dead time driver works like a **decorator**. This is also reflected in the function parameters of :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_dead_time`, where it takes the primary generator handle (``in_generator``), and returns a new generator (``out_generator``) after applying the dead time. Please note, if the ``out_generator`` and ``in_generator`` are the same, it means you are adding the time delay to the PWM waveform in an "in-place" fashion. In turn, if the ``out_generator`` and ``in_generator`` are different, it means you are deriving a new PWM waveform from the existing ``in_generator``.

Dead time specific configuration is listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_dead_time_config_t` structure:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_dead_time_config_t::posedge_delay_ticks` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_dead_time_config_t::negedge_delay_ticks` set the number of ticks to delay the PWM waveform on the rising and falling edge. Specifically, setting both of them to zero means bypassing the dead time module. The resolution of the dead time tick is the same as the timer that is connected with the operator by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_connect_timer`.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_dead_time_config_t::invert_output` sets whether to invert the signal after applying the dead time, which can be used to control the delay edge polarity.

.. warning::

    Due to the hardware limitation, one delay module (either ``posedge delay`` or ``negedge delay``) can not be applied to multiple MCPWM generators at the same time. e.g., the following configuration is **invalid**:

    .. code:: c

        mcpwm_dead_time_config_t dt_config = {
            .posedge_delay_ticks = 10,
        };
        // Set posedge delay to generator A
        mcpwm_generator_set_dead_time(mcpwm_gen_a, mcpwm_gen_a, &dt_config);
        // NOTE: This is invalid, you can not apply the posedge delay to another generator
        mcpwm_generator_set_dead_time(mcpwm_gen_b, mcpwm_gen_b, &dt_config);

    However, you can apply ``posedge delay`` to generator A and ``negedge delay`` to generator B. You can also set both ``posedge delay`` and ``negedge delay`` for generator B, while letting generator A bypass the dead time module. Note that if ``negedge delay`` and ``posedge delay`` are both set for generator A, generator B will not be available. Where generator A is the first generator requested through the operator handle and generator B is the second generator requested through an operator handle.

.. note::

    It is also possible to generate the required dead time by setting `Generator Actions on Events <#generator-actions-on-events>`__, especially by controlling edge placement using different comparators. However, if the more classical edge delay-based dead time with polarity control is required, then the dead time submodule should be used.

.. _mcpwm-carrier-modulation:

Carrier Modulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MCPWM operator has a carrier submodule that can be used if galvanic isolation from the motor driver is required (e.g., isolated digital power application) by passing the PWM output signals through transformers. Any of the PWM output signals may be at 100% duty and not changing whenever a motor is required to run steadily at the full load. Coupling with non-alternating signals with a transformer is problematic, so the signals are modulated by the carrier submodule to create an AC waveform, to make the coupling possible.

To configure the carrier submodule, you can call :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_apply_carrier`, and provide configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t`:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::clk_src` sets the clock source of the carrier.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::frequency_hz` indicates carrier frequency in Hz. For more information, please refer to :ref:`mcpwm-resolution-config`.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::duty_cycle` indicates the duty cycle of the carrier. Note that, there are only 7 supported duty cycles: 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::first_pulse_duration_us` indicates the duration of the first pulse in microseconds. The resolution of the first pulse duration is determined by the carrier frequency you set in the :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::frequency_hz`. The first pulse duration can not be zero, and it has to be at least one period of the carrier. A longer pulse width can help conduct the inductance quicker.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::invert_before_modulate` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::invert_after_modulate` set whether to invert the carrier output before and after modulation.

Specifically, the carrier submodule can be disabled by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_apply_carrier` with a ``NULL`` configuration.


.. _mcpwm-faults-and-brake-actions:

Faults and Brake Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MCPWM operator is able to sense external signals with information about the failure of the motor, the power driver or any other device connected. These failure signals are encapsulated into MCPWM fault objects.

You should determine possible failure modes of the motor and what action should be performed on detection of a particular fault, e.g., drive all outputs low for a brushed motor, lock current state for a stepper motor, etc. Because of this action, the motor should be put into a safe state to reduce the likelihood of damage caused by the fault.

Set Operator Brake Mode on Fault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The way that MCPWM operator reacts to the fault is called **Brake**. The MCPWM operator can be configured to perform different brake modes for each fault object by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_set_brake_on_fault`. Specific brake configuration is passed as a structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_brake_config_t`:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_brake_config_t::fault` sets which fault the operator should react to.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_brake_config_t::brake_mode` sets the brake mode that should be used for the fault. The supported brake modes are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_operator_brake_mode_t`. For :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_OPER_BRAKE_MODE_CBC` mode, the operator recovers itself automatically as long as the fault disappears. You can specify the recovery time in :cpp:member:`mcpwm_brake_config_t::cbc_recover_on_tez` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_brake_config_t::cbc_recover_on_tep`. For :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_OPER_BRAKE_MODE_OST` mode, the operator can not recover even though the fault disappears. You have to call :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_recover_from_fault` to manually recover it.

Set Generator Action on Brake Event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One generator can set multiple actions on different brake events, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_brake_event` with a variable number of action configurations. The action configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gen_brake_event_action_t`:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_brake_event_action_t::direction` specifies the timer direction. The supported directions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_direction_t`.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_brake_event_action_t::brake_mode` specifies the brake mode. The supported brake modes are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_operator_brake_mode_t`.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_brake_event_action_t::action` specifies the generator action to be taken. The supported actions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_generator_action_t`.

There is a helper macro :c:macro:`MCPWM_GEN_BRAKE_EVENT_ACTION` to simplify the construction of a brake event action entry.

Please note, the argument list of :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_brake_event` **must** be terminated by :c:macro:`MCPWM_GEN_BRAKE_EVENT_ACTION_END`.

You can also set the brake action one by one by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_action_on_brake_event` without varargs.

Register Fault Event Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCPWM fault detector can inform you when it detects a valid fault or a fault signal disappears. If you have some function that should be called when such an event happens, you should hook your function to the interrupt service routine by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_fault_register_event_callbacks`. The callback function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_fault_event_cb_t`. All supported event callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_fault_event_callbacks_t`:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_fault_event_callbacks_t::on_fault_enter` sets the callback function that will be called when a fault is detected.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_fault_event_callbacks_t::on_fault_exit` sets the callback function that will be called when a fault is cleared.

The callback function is called within the ISR context, so it should **not** attempt to block. For example, you may make sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the ``ISR`` suffix are called within the function.

The parameter ``user_data`` of :cpp:func:`mcpwm_fault_register_event_callbacks` function is used to save your own context. It is passed to the callback function directly.

This function will lazy the install interrupt service for the MCPWM fault, whereas the service can only be removed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_del_fault`.

Register Brake Event Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCPWM operator can inform you when it is going to take a brake action. If you have some function that should be called when this event happens, you should hook your function to the interrupt service routine by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_register_event_callbacks`. The callback function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_brake_event_cb_t`. All supported event callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_operator_event_callbacks_t`:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_operator_event_callbacks_t::on_brake_cbc` sets the callback function that will be called when the operator is going to take a **CBC** action.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_operator_event_callbacks_t::on_brake_ost` sets the callback function that will be called when the operator is going to take an **OST** action.

The callback function is called within the ISR context, so it should **not** attempt to block. For example, you may make sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the ``ISR`` suffix are called within the function.

The parameter ``user_data`` of the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_register_event_callbacks` function is used to save your own context. It will be passed to the callback function directly.

This function will lazy the install interrupt service for the MCPWM operator, whereas the service can only be removed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_del_operator`.


.. _mcpwm-generator-force-actions:

Generator Force Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Software can override generator output level at runtime, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_force_level`. The software force level always has a higher priority than other event actions set in e.g., :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_timer_event`.

- Set the ``level`` to -1 means to disable the force action, and the generator's output level will be controlled by the event actions again.
- Set the ``hold_on`` to true, and the force output level will keep alive until it is removed by assigning ``level`` to -1.
- Set the ``hole_on`` to false, the force output level will only be active for a short time, and any upcoming event can override it.


.. _mcpwm-synchronization:

Synchronization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a sync signal is taken by the MCPWM timer, the timer will be forced into a predefined **phase**, where the phase is determined by count value and count direction. You can set the sync phase by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_set_phase_on_sync`. The sync phase configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t` structure:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t::sync_src` sets the sync signal source. See `MCPWM Sync Sources <#mcpwm-sync-sources>`__ for how to create a sync source object. Specifically, if this is set to ``NULL``, the driver will disable the sync feature for the MCPWM timer.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t::count_value` sets the count value to load when the sync signal is taken.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t::direction` sets the count direction when the sync signal is taken.

.. note::

    When the MCPWM timer is working in :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_TIMER_COUNT_MODE_UP_DOWN` mode, special attention needs to be taken. In this mode, counter range ``[0 -> peak-1]`` belongs to the **increment** phase, and counter range ``[peak -> 1]`` belongs to the **decrement** phase. Thus if you set the :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t::count_value` to zero, you may also want to set the :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t::direction` to :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_TIMER_DIRECTION_UP`. Otherwise, the timer will be continue with the decrement phase, and the count value underflows to ``peak``.

Likewise, the `MCPWM Capture Timer <#mcpwm-capture-timer-and-channels>`__ can be synced as well. You can set the sync phase for the capture timer by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_set_phase_on_sync`. The sync phase configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_timer_sync_phase_config_t` structure:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_sync_phase_config_t::sync_src` sets the sync signal source. See `MCPWM Sync Sources <#mcpwm-sync-sources>`__ for how to create a sync source object. Specifically, if this is set to ``NULL``, the driver will disable the sync feature for the MCPWM capture timer.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_sync_phase_config_t::count_value` sets the count value to load when the sync signal is taken.
- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_sync_phase_config_t::direction` sets the count direction when the sync signal is taken. Note that, different from MCPWM Timer, the capture timer can only support one count direction: :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_TIMER_DIRECTION_UP`.

        }
    }


.. _mcpwm-capture:

Capture
^^^^^^^

The basic functionality of MCPWM capture is to record the time when any pulse edge of the capture signal turns active. Then you can get the pulse width and convert it into other physical quantities like distance or speed in the capture callback function. For example, in the BLDC (Brushless DC, see figure below) scenario, you can use the capture submodule to sense the rotor position from the Hall sensor.

.. figure:: ../../../_static/mcpwm-bldc-control.png
    :align: center
    :alt: MCPWM BLDC with Hall Sensor

    MCPWM BLDC with Hall Sensor

The capture timer is usually connected to several capture channels. Please refer to `MCPWM Capture Timer and Channels <#mcpwm-capture-timer-and-channels>`__ for more information about resource allocation.

Register Capture Event Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCPWM capture channel can inform you when there is a valid edge detected on the signal. You have to register a callback function to get the timer count value of the captured moment, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_register_event_callbacks`. The callback function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_event_cb_t`. All supported capture callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_event_callbacks_t`:

- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_event_callbacks_t::on_cap` sets the callback function for the capture channel when a valid edge is detected.

The callback function provides event-specific data of type :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_event_data_t`, so that you can get the edge of the capture signal in :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_event_data_t::cap_edge` and the count value of that moment in :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_event_data_t::cap_value`. To convert the capture count into a timestamp, you need to know the resolution of the capture timer by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_get_resolution`.

The callback function is called within the ISR context, so it should **not** attempt to block. For example, you may make sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the ``ISR`` suffix are called within the function.

The parameter ``user_data`` of :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_register_event_callbacks` function is used to save your context. It is passed to the callback function directly.

This function will lazy install interrupt service for the MCPWM capture channel, whereas the service can only be removed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_del_capture_channel`.

Enable and Disable Capture Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The capture channel is not enabled after allocation by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_capture_channel`. You should call :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_enable` and :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_disable` accordingly to enable or disable the channel. If the interrupt service is lazy installed during registering event callbacks for the channel in :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_register_event_callbacks`, :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_enable` will enable the interrupt service as well.

Enable and Disable Capture Timer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before doing IO control to the capture timer, you need to enable the timer first, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_enable`. Internally, this function:

* switches the capture timer state from **init** to **enable**.
* acquires a proper power management lock if a specific clock source (e.g., APB clock) is selected. See also `Power management <#power-management>`__ for more information.

On the contrary, calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_disable` will put the timer driver back to **init** state, and release the power management lock.

Start and Stop Capture Timer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic IO operation of a capture timer is to start and stop. Calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_start` can start the timer and calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_stop` can stop the timer immediately.

Trigger a Software Capture Event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, the software also wants to trigger a "fake" capture event. The :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_trigger_soft_catch` is provided for that purpose. Please note that, even though it is a "fake" capture event, it can still cause an interrupt, thus your capture event callback function gets invoked as well.

.. only:: SOC_MCPWM_SUPPORT_ETM

    .. _mcpwm-etm-event-and-task:

    ETM Event and Task
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    MCPWM comparator is able to generate events that can interact with the :doc:`ETM </api-reference/peripherals/etm>` module. The supported events are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_comparator_etm_event_type_t`. You can call :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_new_etm_event` to get the corresponding ETM event handle.

    For how to connect the event and task to an ETM channel, please refer to the :doc:`ETM </api-reference/peripherals/etm>` documentation.

    .. _mcpwm-power-management:

.. only:: not SOC_MCPWM_SUPPORT_ETM

    .. _mcpwm-power-management:

Power Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When power management is enabled (i.e., :ref:`CONFIG_PM_ENABLE` is on), the system will adjust the PLL and APB frequency before going into Light-sleep, thus potentially changing the period of an MCPWM timers' counting step and leading to inaccurate time-keeping.

However, the driver can prevent the system from going into Light-sleep by acquiring a power management lock of type :cpp:enumerator:`ESP_PM_NO_LIGHT_SLEEP`. Whenever the driver creates an MCPWM timer instance that has selected PLL as its clock source, the driver guarantees that the power management lock is acquired when enabling the timer by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_enable`. On the contrary, the driver releases the lock when :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_disable` is called for that timer.

Likewise, whenever the driver creates an MCPWM capture timer instance, the driver guarantees that the power management lock is acquired when enabling the timer by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_enable`. And releases the lock in  :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_disable`.

.. only:: SOC_MCPWM_SUPPORT_SLEEP_RETENTION

    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports to retain the MCPWM register context before entering **Light-sleep** and restore them after woke up. Which means you don't have to re-init the MCPWM driver after the **Light-sleep**.

    This feature can be enabled by setting the flag :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::allow_pd` or :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_config_t::allow_pd`. It will allow the system to power down the MCPWM in Light-sleep, meanwhile save the MCPWM register context. It can help to save more power consumption with some extra cost of the memory.

.. _mcpwm-resolution-config:

Resolution Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MCPWM group has clock dividers and some sub-modules will have their own clock dividers. The final clock frequency of the sub-module depends on the group clock divider and its own divider (if any). The group clock divider affects all submodules. When configuring the clock frequency (also called resolution) of an MCPWM submodule, the driver sets the divider according to the following rules:

1. If the clock frequency of the submodule can be divisible by the clock source, the frequency of the submodule is prioritized to ensure the accuracy of the submodule.
2. If it cannot be divisible by the clock source, the group clock is guaranteed to have the highest frequency possible, and the submodule frequency is adjusted to the closest frequency that can be divisible by the clock source.

When multiple MCPWM submodules coexist, you need to consider whether there is a clock divider conflict. When there is a group clock divider conflict, try adjusting the submodule allocation order. See [`TRM <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#mcpwm>`__] for details on group frequency divider and submodule frequency divider ranges.

.. _mcpwm-iram-safe:

IRAM Safe
^^^^^^^^^

By default, the MCPWM interrupt will be deferred when the Cache is disabled for reasons like writing/erasing Flash. Thus the event callback functions will not get executed in time, which is not expected in a real-time application.

There is a Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_MCPWM_ISR_CACHE_SAFE` that:

* enables the interrupt to be serviced even when the cache is disabled
* places all functions used by the ISR into IRAM [2]_
* places the driver object into DRAM (in case it is mapped to PSRAM by accident)

This allows the interrupt to run while the cache is disabled but comes at the cost of increased IRAM consumption.

There is another Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_MCPWM_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM` that can put commonly used IO control functions into IRAM as well. So, these functions can also be executable when the cache is disabled. The IO control function is as follows:

- :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_set_compare_value`
- :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_set_period`


.. _mcpwm-thread-safety:

Thread Safety
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The factory functions like :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_timer` are guaranteed to be thread-safe by the driver, which means, you can call it from different RTOS tasks without protection by extra locks.

The following function is allowed to run under the ISR context, as the driver uses a critical section to prevent them from being called concurrently in the task and ISR.

- :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_set_compare_value`
- :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_set_period`

Other functions that are not related to `Resource Allocation and Initialization  <#resource-allocation-and-initialization>`__, are not thread-safe. Thus, you should avoid calling them in different tasks without mutex protection.

Kconfig Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :ref:`CONFIG_MCPWM_ISR_CACHE_SAFE` controls whether the default ISR handler can work when the cache is disabled, see :ref:`mcpwm-iram-safe` for more information.
- :ref:`CONFIG_MCPWM_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM` controls where to place the MCPWM control functions (IRAM or flash), see :ref:`mcpwm-iram-safe` for more information.
- :ref:`CONFIG_MCPWM_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG` is used to enable the debug log output. Enabling this option will increase the firmware binary size.

Application Examples
--------------------

* :example:`peripherals/mcpwm/mcpwm_bdc_speed_control` demonstrates how to drive a brushed DC motor using two specific PWM signals, measure the motor speed with a photoelectric encoder, and maintain a stable motor speed using a simple PID algorithm.
* :example:`peripherals/mcpwm/mcpwm_bldc_hall_control` demonstrates how to use the MCPWM peripheral to control a BLDC motor using a six-step commutation scheme, with the motor's spin direction and speed being adjusted based on the readings from a Hall sensor.
* :example:`peripherals/mcpwm/mcpwm_capture_hc_sr04` demonstrates how to use the MCPWM peripheral's capture module to decode the pulse width signals from an HC-SR04 sonar sensor, which can measure distance based on the width of the pulse.
* :example:`peripherals/mcpwm/mcpwm_foc_svpwm_open_loop` demonstrates how to use the MCPWM peripheral to generate three pairs of PWM signals for Field-Oriented Control (FOC), which can be used to drive a BLDC or PMSM motor, or a three-phase power inverter, using an open-loop FOC algorithm.
* :example:`peripherals/mcpwm/mcpwm_servo_control` demonstrates how to control a typical RC Servo by sending a PWM signal using the MCPWM driver, with the servo rotating from -60° to 60° and then turning back again.
* :example:`peripherals/mcpwm/mcpwm_sync` demonstrates how to generate three PWMs in perfect synchronization using MCPWM timers, with options to synchronize the timers via GPIO, Timer TEZ, or software.

.. [1]
   Different ESP chip series might have a different number of MCPWM resources (e.g., groups, timers, comparators, operators, generators, triggers and so on). Please refer to the [`TRM <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#mcpwm>`__] for details. The driver does not forbid you from applying for more MCPWM resources, but it returns an error when there are no hardware resources available. Please always check the return value when doing :ref:`mcpwm-resource-allocation-and-initialization`.

.. [2]
   The callback function and the sub-functions invoked by itself should also be placed in IRAM. You need to take care of this by yourself.
