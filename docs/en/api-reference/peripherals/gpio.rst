GPIO Summary
------------

.. include:: gpio/{IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}.inc
    :start-after: gpio-summary
    :end-before: ---


.. only:: SOC_RTCIO_INPUT_OUTPUT_SUPPORTED

    There is also separate "RTC GPIO" support, which functions when GPIOs are routed to the "RTC" low-power and analog subsystem. These pin functions can be used when:

    .. list::

        - In Deep-sleep mode
        :SOC_ULP_SUPPORTED and not esp32c6: - The :doc:`Ultra Low Power co-processor <../../api-reference/system/ulp>` is running
        - Analog functions such as ADC/DAC/etc are in use.


.. only:: SOC_GPIO_SUPPORT_PIN_GLITCH_FILTER or SOC_GPIO_FLEX_GLITCH_FILTER_NUM

    GPIO Glitch Filter
    ------------------

	The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip features hardware filters to remove unwanted glitch pulses from the input GPIO, which can help reduce false triggering of the interrupt and prevent a noise being routed to the peripheral side.

	.. only:: SOC_GPIO_SUPPORT_PIN_GLITCH_FILTER

		Each GPIO can be configured with a glitch filter, which can be used to filter out pulses shorter than **two** sample clock cycles. The duration of the filter is not configurable. The sample clock is the clock source of the IO_MUX. In the driver, we call this kind of filter as ``pin glitch filter``. You can create the filter handle by calling :cpp:func:`gpio_new_pin_glitch_filter`. All the configurations for a pin glitch filter are listed in the :cpp:type:`gpio_pin_glitch_filter_config_t` structure.

		- :cpp:member:`gpio_pin_glitch_filter_config_t::gpio_num` sets the GPIO number to enable the glitch filter.

	.. only:: SOC_GPIO_FLEX_GLITCH_FILTER_NUM

		{IDF_TARGET_FLEX_GLITCH_FILTER_NUM:default="8"}

		{IDF_TARGET_NAME} provides {IDF_TARGET_FLEX_GLITCH_FILTER_NUM} flexible glitch filters, whose duration is configurable. We refer to this kind of filter as ``flex flitch filter``. Each of them can be applied to any input GPIO. However, applying multiple filters to the same GPIO doesn't make difference from one. You can create the filter handle by calling :cpp:func:`gpio_new_flex_glitch_filter`. All the configurations for a flexible glitch filter are listed in the :cpp:type:`gpio_flex_glitch_filter_config_t` structure.

		- :cpp:member:`gpio_flex_glitch_filter_config_t::gpio_num` sets the GPIO that will be applied to the flex glitch filter.
		- :cpp:member:`gpio_flex_glitch_filter_config_t::window_width_ns` and :cpp:member:`gpio_flex_glitch_filter_config_t::window_thres_ns` are the key parameters of the glitch filter. During :cpp:member:`gpio_flex_glitch_filter_config_t::window_width_ns`, any pulse whose width is shorter than :cpp:member:`gpio_flex_glitch_filter_config_t::window_thres_ns` will be discarded. Please note that, you can't set :cpp:member:`gpio_flex_glitch_filter_config_t::window_thres_ns` bigger than :cpp:member:`gpio_flex_glitch_filter_config_t::window_width_ns`.

	.. only:: SOC_GPIO_SUPPORT_PIN_GLITCH_FILTER and SOC_GPIO_FLEX_GLITCH_FILTER_NUM

		Please note, the ``pin glitch filter`` and ``flex glitch filter`` are independent. You can enable both of them for the same GPIO.

	The glitch filter is disabled by default, and can be enabled by calling :cpp:func:`gpio_glitch_filter_enable`. To recycle the filter, you can call :cpp:func:`gpio_del_glitch_filter`. Please note, before deleting the filter, you should disable it first by calling :cpp:func:`gpio_glitch_filter_disable`.


.. only:: SOC_GPIO_SUPPORT_PIN_HYS_FILTER

    GPIO Hysteresis Filter
    ----------------------

    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} support the hardware hysteresis of the input pin, which can reduce the GPIO interrupt shoot by accident due to unstable sampling when the input voltage is near the critical of logic 0 and 1, especially when the input logic level conversion is slow or the voltage setup time is too long.

    Each pin can enable hysteresis function independently. By default, it controlled by eFuse and been closed, but it can also be enabled or disabled by software manually. You can select the hysteresis control mode by configuring :cpp:member:`gpio_config_t::hys_ctrl_mode`.

    .. note::

        When the hysteresis function is controlled by eFuse, this feature can still be controlled independently for each pin, you need to `burn the eFuse <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/espefuse/index.html>`_ to enable the hysteresis function on specific GPIO additionally.
