SPI Flash API ESP-IDF version vs Chip-ROM version
=================================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

There is a set of SPI Flash drivers in Chip-ROM which you can use by enabling  :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_ROM_IMPL`. Most of the ESP-IDF SPI Flash driver code are in internal RAM, therefore enabling this option will free some internal RAM usage. Note if you enable this option, this means some SPI Flash driver features and bugfixes that are done in ESP-IDF might not be included in the Chip-ROM version.


Feature Supported by ESP-IDF but not in Chip-ROM
------------------------------------------------

.. list::

    - Octal Flash chip support. See :ref:`oct-flash-doc` for details.
    - 32-bit-address support for GD25Q256. See :ref:`32-bit-flash-doc` for details.
    - TH Flash chip support.
    - Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_CHECK_ERASE_TIMEOUT_DISABLED`.
    - :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_VERIFY_WRITE`, enabling this option helps you detect bad writing.
    - :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_LOG_FAILED_WRITE`, enabling this option will print the bad writing.
    - :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_WARN_SETTING_ZERO_TO_ONE`, enabling this option will check if you're writing zero to one.
    - :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_DANGEROUS_WRITE`, enabling this option will check for flash programming to certain protected regions like bootloader, partition table or application itself.
    - :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_ENABLE_COUNTERS`, enabling this option to collect performance data for ESP-IDF SPI Flash driver APIs.

Bugfixes Introduced in ESP-IDF but not in Chip-ROM
--------------------------------------------------
