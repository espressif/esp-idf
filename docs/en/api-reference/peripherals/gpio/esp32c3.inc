The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip features 22 physical GPIO pins (GPIO0 ~ GPIO21). Each pin can be used as a general-purpose I/O, or be connected to an internal peripheral signal. Through GPIO matrix and IO MUX, peripheral input signals can be from any IO pins, and peripheral output signals can be routed to any IO pins. Together these modules provide highly configurable I/O. For more details, see *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *IO MUX and GPIO Matrix (GPIO, IO_MUX)* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#iomuxgpio>`__].

The table below provides more information on pin usage, and please note the comments in the table for GPIOs with restrictions.

.. note::

    - Strapping pin: GPIO2, GPIO8 and GPIO9 are strapping pins. For more information, please refer to `ESP32-C3 Datasheet <{IDF_TARGET_DATASHEET_EN_URL}>`_.
    - SPI0/1: GPIO12-17 are usually used for SPI flash and PSRAM and are not recommended for other uses.
    - USB-JTAG: GPIO 18 and 19 are used by USB-JTAG by default. In order to use them as GPIOs, USB-JTAG will be disabled by the drivers.
    - RTC: GPIO0-5 can be used to wake up the chip from Deep-sleep mode. Other GPIOs can only wake up the chip from Light-sleep mode. For more information, please refer to Section :ref:`Wakeup Sources<api-reference-wakeup-source>`.
