The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip features 31 physical GPIO pins (GPIO0 ~ GPIO30). Each pin can be used as a general-purpose I/O, or to be connected to an internal peripheral signal. Through GPIO matrix and IO MUX, peripheral input signals can be from any IO pins, and peripheral output signals can be routed to any IO pins. Together these modules provide highly configurable I/O. For more details, see *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *IO MUX and GPIO Matrix (GPIO, IO_MUX)* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#iomuxgpio>`__].

The table below provides more information on pin usage, and please note the comments in the table for GPIOs with restrictions.

.. note::

    - Strapping pin: GPIO4, GPIO5, GPIO8, GPIO9, and GPIO15 are strapping pins. For more infomation, please refer to `datasheet <{IDF_TARGET_DATASHEET_EN_URL}>`__.
	  - SPI0/1: GPIO24-30 are usually used for SPI flash and not recommended for other uses.
	  - USB-JTAG: GPIO 12 and 13 are used by USB-JTAG by default. In order to use them as GPIOs, USB-JTAG will be disabled by the drivers.
    - For chip variants with an SiP flash built in, GPIO24 ~ GPIO30 are dedicated to connecting the SiP flash; GPIO10 ~ GPIO11 are not led out to any chip pins; therefore, only the remaining 22 GPIO pins are available.
    - For chip variants without an in-package flash, GPIO14 is not led out to any chip pins.
