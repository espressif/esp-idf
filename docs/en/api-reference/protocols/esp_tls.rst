ESP-TLS
=======

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

Overview
--------

The ESP-TLS component provides a simplified API interface for accessing the commonly used TLS functions. It supports common scenarios like CA certification validation, SNI, ALPN negotiation, and non-blocking connection among others. All the configurations can be specified in the ``esp_tls_cfg_t`` data structure. Once done, TLS communication can be conducted using the following APIs:

    * :cpp:func:`esp_tls_init`: for initializing the TLS connection handle.
    * :cpp:func:`esp_tls_conn_new_sync`: for opening a new blocking TLS connection.
    * :cpp:func:`esp_tls_conn_new_async`: for opening a new non-blocking TLS connection.
    * :cpp:func:`esp_tls_conn_read`: for reading from the connection.
    * :cpp:func:`esp_tls_conn_write`: for writing into the connection.
    * :cpp:func:`esp_tls_conn_destroy`: for freeing up the connection.

Any application layer protocol like HTTP1, HTTP2, etc can be executed on top of this layer.

The ESP-TLS component has a file :component_file:`esp-tls/esp_tls.h` which contains the public API headers for the component. Internally, the ESP-TLS component operates using either MbedTLS or WolfSSL, which are SSL/TLS libraries. APIs specific to MbedTLS are present in :component_file:`esp-tls/private_include/esp_tls_mbedtls.h` and APIs specific to WolfSSL are present in :component_file:`esp-tls/private_include/esp_tls_wolfssl.h`.

.. _esp_tls_server_verification:

TLS Server Verification
-----------------------

ESP-TLS provides multiple options for TLS server verification on the client side. The ESP-TLS client can verify the server by validating the peer's server certificate or with the help of pre-shared keys. The user should select only one of the following options in the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure for TLS server verification. If no option is selected, the client will return a fatal error by default during the TLS connection setup.

    *  **cacert_buf** and **cacert_bytes**: The CA certificate can be provided in a buffer to the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure. The ESP-TLS will use the CA certificate present in the buffer to verify the server. The following variables in the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure must be set.

        * ``cacert_buf`` - pointer to the buffer which contains the CA certification.
        * ``cacert_bytes`` - the size of the CA certificate in bytes.
    * **use_global_ca_store**: The ``global_ca_store`` can be initialized and set at once. Then it can be used to verify the server for all the ESP-TLS connections which have set ``use_global_ca_store = true`` in their respective :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure. See the API Reference section below for information regarding different APIs used for initializing and setting up the ``global_ca_store``.
    * **crt_bundle_attach**: The ESP x509 Certificate Bundle API provides an easy way to include a bundle of custom x509 root certificates for TLS server verification. More details can be found at :doc:`ESP x509 Certificate Bundle</api-reference/protocols/esp_crt_bundle>`.
    * **psk_hint_key**: To use pre-shared keys for server verification, :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TLS_PSK_VERIFICATION` should be enabled in the ESP-TLS menuconfig. Then the pointer to the PSK hint and key should be provided to the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure. The ESP-TLS will use the PSK for server verification only when no other option regarding server verification is selected.
    * **skip server verification**: This is an insecure option provided in the ESP-TLS for testing purposes. The option can be set by enabling :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TLS_INSECURE` and :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TLS_SKIP_SERVER_CERT_VERIFY` in the ESP-TLS menuconfig. When this option is enabled the ESP-TLS will skip server verification by default when no other options for server verification are selected in the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure.

    .. warning::

        Enabling this option comes with a potential risk of establishing a TLS connection with a server that has a fake identity, provided that the server certificate is not provided either through API or other mechanisms like ca_store etc.

ESP-TLS Server Cert Selection Hook
----------------------------------

The ESP-TLS component provides an option to set the server certification selection hook when using the MbedTLS stack. This provides an ability to configure and use a certificate selection callback during server handshake. The callback helps to select a certificate to present to the client based on the TLS extensions supplied in the client hello message, such as ALPN and SNI. To enable this feature, please enable  :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TLS_SERVER_CERT_SELECT_HOOK` in the ESP-TLS menuconfig.

The certificate selection callback can be configured in the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure as follows:

.. code-block:: c
    
    int cert_selection_callback(mbedtls_ssl_context *ssl)
    {
        /* Code that the callback should execute */
        return 0;
    }

    esp_tls_cfg_t cfg = {
        cert_select_cb = cert_section_callback,
    };

.. _esp_tls_wolfssl:

Underlying SSL/TLS Library Options
----------------------------------

The ESP-TLS component offers the option to use MbedTLS or WolfSSL as its underlying SSL/TLS library. By default, only MbedTLS is available and used, WolfSSL SSL/TLS library is also available publicly at https://github.com/espressif/esp-wolfssl. The repository provides the WolfSSL component in binary format, and it also provides a few examples that are useful for understanding the API. Please refer to the repository ``README.md`` for information on licensing and other options. Please see the below section for instructions on how to use WolfSSL in your project.

.. note::   `As the library options are internal to ESP-TLS, switching the libraries will not change ESP-TLS specific code for a project.`

How to Use WolfSSL with ESP-IDF
-------------------------------

There are two ways to use WolfSSL in your project：

1) Directly add WolfSSL as a component in your project with the following three commands::

    (First, change the directory (cd) to your project directory)
    mkdir components
    cd components
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-wolfssl.git

2) Add WolfSSL as an extra component in your project.

* Download WolfSSL with::

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-wolfssl.git

* Include ESP-WolfSSL in ESP-IDF with setting ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`` in ``CMakeLists.txt`` of your project as done in `wolfssl/examples <https://github.com/espressif/esp-wolfssl/tree/master/examples>`_. For reference see :ref:`optional_project_variable` in :doc:`build-system.</api-guides/build-system>`.

After the above steps, you will have the option to choose WolfSSL as the underlying SSL/TLS library in the configuration menu of your project as follows::

    idf.py menuconfig > ESP-TLS > SSL/TLS Library > Mbedtls/Wolfssl

Comparison Between MbedTLS and WolfSSL
--------------------------------------

The following table shows a typical comparison between WolfSSL and MbedTLS when the :example:`protocols/https_request` example (which includes server authentication) is running with both SSL/TLS libraries and with all respective configurations set to default. For MbedTLS, the IN_CONTENT length and OUT_CONTENT length are set to 16384 bytes and 4096 bytes respectively.

    ATECC608A (Secure Element) with ESP-TLS
    --------------------------------------------------

    ESP-TLS provides support for using ATECC608A cryptoauth chip with ESP32-WROOM-32SE. The use of ATECC608A is supported only when ESP-TLS is used with MbedTLS as its underlying SSL/TLS stack. ESP-TLS uses MbedTLS as its underlying TLS/SSL stack by default unless changed manually.

    .. note:: ATECC608A chip on ESP32-WROOM-32SE must be already configured, for details refer `esp_cryptoauth_utility <https://github.com/espressif/esp-cryptoauthlib/blob/master/esp_cryptoauth_utility/README.md#esp_cryptoauth_utility>`_.

    To enable the secure element support, and use it in your project for TLS connection, you will have to follow the below steps:

    1) Add `esp-cryptoauthlib <https://github.com/espressif/esp-cryptoauthlib>`_ in your project, for details please refer `how to use esp-cryptoauthlib with ESP-IDF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-cryptoauthlib#how-to-use-esp-cryptoauthlib-with-esp-idf>`_.

    2) Enable the following menuconfig option::

        menuconfig > Component config > ESP-TLS > Use Secure Element (ATECC608A) with ESP-TLS

    3) Select type of ATECC608A chip with following option::

        menuconfig > Component config > esp-cryptoauthlib > Choose Type of ATECC608A chip

    To know more about different types of ATECC608A chips and how to obtain the type of ATECC608A connected to your ESP module, please visit `ATECC608A chip type <https://github.com/espressif/esp-cryptoauthlib/blob/master/esp_cryptoauth_utility/README.md#find-type-of-atecc608a-chip-connected-to-esp32-wroom32-se>`_.

    1) Enable the use of ATECC608A in ESP-TLS by providing the following config option in :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t`.

    .. code-block:: c

            esp_tls_cfg_t cfg = {
                /* other configurations options */
                .use_secure_element = true,
            };

.. only:: SOC_DIG_SIGN_SUPPORTED

    .. _digital-signature-with-esp-tls:

    Digital Signature with ESP-TLS
    ------------------------------

    ESP-TLS provides support for using the Digital Signature (DS) with {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. Use of the DS for TLS is supported only when ESP-TLS is used with MbedTLS (default stack) as its underlying SSL/TLS stack. For more details on Digital Signature, please refer to the :doc:`Digital Signature (DS) </api-reference/peripherals/ds>`. The technical details of Digital Signature such as how to calculate private key parameters can be found in *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *Digital Signature (DS)* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#digsig>`__]. The DS peripheral must be configured before it can be used to perform Digital Signature, see :ref:`configure-the-ds-peripheral`.

    The DS peripheral must be initialized with the required encrypted private key parameters, which are obtained when the DS peripheral is configured. ESP-TLS internally initializes the DS peripheral when provided with the required DS context, i.e., DS parameters. Please see the below code snippet for passing the DS context to the ESP-TLS context. The DS context passed to the ESP-TLS context should not be freed till the TLS connection is deleted.

    .. code-block:: c

            #include "esp_tls.h"
            esp_ds_data_ctx_t *ds_ctx;
            /* initialize ds_ctx with encrypted private key parameters, which can be read from the nvs or provided through the application code */
            esp_tls_cfg_t cfg = {
                .clientcert_buf = /* the client certification */,
                .clientcert_bytes = /* length of the client certification */,
                /* other configurations options */
                .ds_data = (void *)ds_ctx,
            };

    .. note:: When using Digital Signature for the TLS connection, along with the other required params, only the client certification (`clientcert_buf`) and the DS params (`ds_data`) are required and the client key (`clientkey_buf`) can be set to NULL.

    * An example of mutual authentication with the DS peripheral can be found at :example:`ssl mutual auth<protocols/mqtt/ssl_mutual_auth>` which internally uses (ESP-TLS) for the TLS connection.

TLS Ciphersuites
------------------------------------
ESP-TLS provides the ability to set a ciphersuites list in client mode. The TLS ciphersuites list informs the server about the supported ciphersuites for the specific TLS connection regardless of the TLS stack configuration. If the server supports any ciphersuite from this list, then the TLS connection will succeed; otherwise, it will fail.

You can set ``ciphersuites_list`` in the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure during client connection as follows:

.. code-block:: c

    /* ciphersuites_list must end with 0 and must be available in the memory scope active during the entire TLS connection */
    static const int ciphersuites_list[] = {MBEDTLS_TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, MBEDTLS_TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, 0};
    esp_tls_cfg_t cfg = {
        .ciphersuites_list = ciphersuites_list,
    };

ESP-TLS will not check the validity of ``ciphersuites_list`` that was set, you should call :cpp:func:`esp_tls_get_ciphersuites_list` to get ciphersuites list supported in the TLS stack and cross-check it against the supplied list.

.. note::
   This feature is supported only in the MbedTLS stack.
