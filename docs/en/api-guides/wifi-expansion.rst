.. only:: not SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED

  {IDF_TARGET_NAME} does not support Wi-Fi functionality natively, but it is possible to use the same Wi-Fi API and features using Wi-Fi expansion.

.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED

  {IDF_TARGET_NAME} does support Wi-Fi functionality natively, please refer to :doc:`wifi` documentation. Even though Wi-Fi is supported on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, it is possible to expand it and use another instance of Wi-Fi expansion interfaces using esp_wifi_remote <https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_wifi_remote>`_ component.


The principle of Wi-Fi Expansion operation is to add another ESP32 series, Wi-Fi capable, target connected to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} in a pre-defined way. Your project could then include the `esp_wifi_remote <https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_wifi_remote>`_ component using:

.. code:: bash

  idf.py add-dependency esp_wifi_remote


Please follow the instructions described in the `esp_wifi_remote documentation <https://github.com/espressif/esp-protocols/blob/master/components/esp_wifi_remote/README.md>`_.


.. only:: not SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED

  To explore the Wi-Fi Expansion functionality on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, you can get started with this example: :idf_file:`examples/protocols/mqtt/tcp/README.md` and choose Wi-Fi connection in the project configuration menu.
