Building OpenOCD from Sources for MacOS

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

The following instructions are alternative to downloading binary OpenOCD from `Espressif GitHub <https://github.com/espressif/openocd-esp32/releases>`_. To quickly setup the binary OpenOCD, instead of compiling it yourself, backup and proceed to section :ref:`jtag-debugging-setup-openocd`.

Download Sources of OpenOCD
===========================

The sources for the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}-enabled variant of OpenOCD are available from Espressif GitHub under https://github.com/espressif/openocd-esp32. To download the sources, use the following commands::

    cd ~/esp
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/openocd-esp32.git

The clone of sources should be now saved in ``~/esp/openocd-esp32`` directory.


Install Dependencies
====================

Install packages that are required to compile OpenOCD using Homebrew::

    brew install automake libtool libusb wget gcc@4.9 pkg-config


Build OpenOCD
=============

Proceed with configuring and building OpenOCD::

    cd ~/esp/openocd-esp32
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    make

Optionally you can add ``sudo make install`` step at the end. Skip it, if you have an existing OpenOCD (from e.g. another development platform), as it may get overwritten.

.. note::

    * Should an error occur, resolve it and try again until the command ``make`` works.
    * If there is a submodule problem from OpenOCD, please ``cd`` to the ``openocd-esp32`` directory and input ``git submodule update --init``.
    * If the ``./configure`` is successfully run, information of enabled JTAG will be printed under ``OpenOCD configuration summary``.
    * If the information of your device is not shown in the log, use ``./configure`` to enable it as described in  ``../openocd-esp32/doc/INSTALL.txt``.
    * For details concerning compiling OpenOCD, please refer to ``openocd-esp32/README.OSX``.

Once ``make`` process is successfully completed, the executable of OpenOCD will be saved in ``~/esp/openocd-esp32/src/openocd`` directory.


Next Steps
