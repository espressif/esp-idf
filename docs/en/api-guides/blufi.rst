:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

Overview
--------

The BluFi for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is a Wi-Fi network configuration function via Bluetooth channel. It provides a secure protocol to pass Wi-Fi configuration and credentials to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. Using this information, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} can then connect to an AP or establish a SoftAP.

Fragmenting, data encryption, and checksum verification in the BluFi layer are the key elements of this process.

You can customize symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and checksum support customization. Here we use the DH algorithm for key negotiation, 128-AES algorithm for data encryption, and CRC16 algorithm for checksum verification.

The BluFi Flow
---------------

The BluFi networking flow includes the configuration of the SoftAP and Station.

The following uses Station as an example to illustrate the core parts of the procedure, including broadcast, connection, service discovery, negotiation of the shared key, data transmission, and connection status backhaul.

1. Set the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} into GATT Server mode and then it will send broadcasts with specific *advertising data*. You can customize this broadcast as needed, which is not a part of the BluFi Profile.

2. Use the App installed on the mobile phone to search for this particular broadcast. The mobile phone will connect to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} as the GATT Client once the broadcast is confirmed. The App used during this part is up to you.

3. After the GATT connection is successfully established, the mobile phone will send a data frame for key negotiation to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} (see the section :ref:`frame_formats` for details).

4. After {IDF_TARGET_NAME} receives the data frame of key negotiation, it will parse the content according to the user-defined negotiation method.

5. The mobile phone works with {IDF_TARGET_NAME} for key negotiation using the encryption algorithms, such as DH, RSA, or ECC.

6. After the negotiation process is completed, the mobile phone will send a control frame for security-mode setup to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.

7. When receiving this control frame, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will be able to encrypt and decrypt the communication data using the shared key and the security configuration.

8. The mobile phone sends the data frame defined in the section of :ref:`frame_formats`，with the Wi-Fi configuration information to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, including SSID, password, etc.

9. The mobile phone sends a control frame of Wi-Fi connection request to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. When receiving this control frame, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will regard the communication of essential information as done and get ready to connect to the Wi-Fi.

10. After connecting to the Wi-Fi, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will send a control frame of Wi-Fi connection status report to the mobile phone. At this point, the networking procedure is completed.

.. note::

    1. After {IDF_TARGET_NAME} receives the control frame of security-mode configuration, it will execute the operations in accordance with the defined security mode.

    2. The data lengths before and after symmetric encryption/decryption must stay the same. It also supports in-place encryption and decryption.

The Frame Formats Defined in BluFi
-----------------------------------

The frame formats for the communication between the mobile phone App and {IDF_TARGET_NAME} are defined as follows:

The frame format with no fragment:

.. list-table::   
   :header-rows: 1    
   :widths: 25 25    
    
   * - Field
     - Value (Byte)
   * - Type (Least Significant Bit)
     - 1
   * - Frame Control
     - 1   
   * - Sequence Number
     - 1
   * - Data Length
     - 1
   * - Data
     - ${Data Length}
   * - CheckSum (Most Siginificant Bit)
     - 2

If the frag frame bit in the **Frame Control** field is enabled, there would be a 2-byte **Total Content Length** field in the **Data** field. This **Total Content Length** field indicates the length of the remaining part of the frame and also tells the remote how much memory needs to be allocated.

The frame format with fragments:

.. list-table::   
   :header-rows: 1    
   :widths: 25 25   
    
   * - Field
     - Value (Byte)
   * - Type (Least Significant Bit)
     - 1
   * - Frame Control (Frag)
     - 1
   * - Sequence Number
     - 1
   * - Data Length
     - 1
   * - Data
     - * Total Content Length: 2
       * Content: ${Data Length} - 2
   * - CheckSum (Most Siginificant Bit)
     - 2

Normally, the control frame does not contain data bits, except for ACK Frame.

The format of ACK Frame:

.. list-table::   
   :header-rows: 1    
   :widths: 25 25

1. Type

   **Type** field takes 1 byte and is divided into **Type** and **Subtype**. **Type** uses the lower two bits, indicating whether the frame is a data frame or a control frame. **Subtype** uses the upper six bits, indicating the specific meaning of this data frame or control frame.

   * The control frame is not encrypted for the time being and supports to be verified.

   * The data frame supports to be encrypted and verified.

2. Frame Control

   The **Frame Control** field takes one byte and each bit has a different meaning.


.. list-table::     
   :header-rows: 1      
   :widths: 10 35    

   * - Bit
     - Meaning     
   * - 0x01
     - Indicates whether the frame is encrypted.

       * 1 means encrypted.
       * 0 means unencrypted.

       The encrypted part of the frame includes the full clear data before the DATA field is encrypted (no checksum). Control frame is not encrypted, so this bit is 0.      
   * - 0x02
     - Indicates whether a frame contains a checksum (such as SHA1, MD5, CRC) for the end of the frame. Data field includes sequence, data length, and clear text. Both the control frame and the data frame can choose whether to contain a check bit or not.     
   * - 0x04
     - Indicates the data direction.

       * 0 means from the mobile phone to the ESP device.
       * 1 means from the ESP device to the mobile phone.      
   * - 0x08
     - Indicates whether the other person is required to reply to an ACK.

       * 0 indicates not required to reply to an ACK.
       * 1 indicates required to reply to an ACK.  
   * - 0x10
     - Indicates whether there are subsequent data fragments.

       * 0 indicates that there is no subsequent data fragment for this frame.
       * 1 indicates that there are subsequent data fragments which used to transmit longer data.
       
       In the case of a frag frame, the total length of the current content section + subsequent content section is given in the first two bytes of the data field (that is, the content data of the maximum support 64 K).  
   * - 0x10~0x80 
     - Reserved     

3. Sequence Number

   The **Sequence Number** field is the field for sequence control. When a frame is sent, the value of this field is automatically incremented by 1 regardless of the type of frame, which prevents Replay Attack. The sequence would be cleared after each reconnection.

4. Data Length

   The **Data Length** field indicates the length of the data field, which does not include CheckSum.

5. Data

   Content of the **Data** field can be different according to various values of Type or Subtype. Please refer to the table above.

6. CheckSum

   The **CheckSum** field takes two bytes, which is used to check "sequence + data length + clear text data".

The Security Implementation of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}
------------------------------------------------

1. Securing Data

   To ensure that the transmission of the Wi-Fi SSID and password is secure, the message needs to be encrypted using symmetric encryption algorithms, such as AES, DES, and so on. Before using symmetric encryption algorithms, the devices are required to negotiate (or generate) a shared key using an asymmetric encryption algorithm (DH, RSA, ECC, etc).

2. Ensuring Data Integrity

   To ensure data integrity, you need to add a checksum algorithm, such as SHA1, MD5, CRC, etc.

3. Securing Identity (Signature)

   Algorithm like RSA can be used to secure identity. But for DH, it needs other algorithms as an companion for signature.

4. Replay Attack Prevention

   It is added to the Sequence Number field and used during the checksum verification.

   For the coding of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, you can determine and develop the security processing, such as key negotiation. The mobile application sends the negotiation data to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, and then the data will be sent to the application layer for processing. If the application layer does not process it, you can use the DH encryption algorithm provided by BluFi to negotiate the key.

   The application layer needs to register several security-related functions to BluFi:

.. code-block:: c

   typedef void (*esp_blufi_negotiate_data_handler_t)(uint8_t *data, int len, uint8_t **output_data, int *output_len, bool *need_free)

This function is for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to receive normal data during negotiation. After processing is completed, the data will be transmitted using Output_data and Output_len.

BluFi will send output_data from Negotiate_data_handler after Negotiate_data_handler is called.

Here are two "*", which means the length of the data to be emitted is unknown. Therefore, it requires the function to allocate itself (malloc) or point to the global variable to inform whether the memory needs to be freed by NEED_FREE.

.. code-block:: c

   typedef int (* esp_blufi_encrypt_func_t)(uint8_t iv8, uint8_t *crypt_data, int crypt_len)

The data to be encrypted and decrypted must be in the same length. The IV8 is an 8-bit sequence value of frames, which can be used as a 8-bit of IV.

.. code-block:: c

   typedef int (* esp_blufi_decrypt_func_t)(uint8_t iv8, uint8_t *crypt_data, int crypt_len)

The data to be encrypted and decrypted must be in the same length. The IV8 is an 8-bit sequence value of frames, which can be used as an 8-bit of IV.

.. code-block:: c

   typedef uint16_t (*esp_blufi_checksum_func_t)(uint8_t iv8, uint8_t *data, int len)

This function is used to compute CheckSum and return a value of CheckSum. BluFi uses the returned value to compare the CheckSum of the frame.
