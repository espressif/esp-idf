Espressif's Frameworks
======================

Here you will find a collection of the official Espressif libraries and frameworks.

Espressif Audio Development Framework
-------------------------------------

The ESP-ADF is a comprehensive framework for audio applications including:

* CODEC's HAL
* Music Players and Recorders
* Audio Processing
* Bluetooth Speakers
* Internet Radios
* Hands-free devices
* Speech Recognition

This framework is available at GitHub: `ESP-ADF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-adf>`_.

ESP-CSI
-------

ESP-CSI is an experimental implementation that uses the Wi-Fi Channel State Information to detect the presence of a human body.

See `ESP-CSI <https://github.com/espressif/esp-csi>`_ project for more information about it.

Espressif DSP Library
---------------------

The library provides algorithms optimized specifically for digital signal processing applications.
This library supports:

* Matrix multiplication
* Dot product
* FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
* IIR (Infinite Impulse Response)
* FIR (Finite Impulse Response)
* Vector math operations

This library is available here: `ESP-DSP library <https://github.com/espressif/esp-dsp>`_.

ESP-WIFI-MESH Development Framework
-----------------------------------

This framework is based on the ESP-WIFI-MESH protocol with the following features:

* Fast network configuration
* Stable upgrade
* Efficient debugging
* LAN control
* Various application demos

`ESP-MDF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-mdf>`_.

ESP-WHO
-------

The ESP-WHO is a face detection and recognition framework using the ESP32 and camera.
To know more about the project, see `ESP-WHO <https://github.com/espressif/esp-who>`_ on GitHub.

ESP RainMaker
-------------

`ESP RainMaker <https://rainmaker.espressif.com/>`_ is a complete solution for accelerated AIoT development.
Using ESP RainMaker, you can create AIoT devices from the firmware to the integration with voice-assistant, phone apps and cloud backend.

ESP-IoT-Solution
----------------

`ESP-IoT-Solution <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-esp-iot-solution/en/latest/>`_ contains commonly used device drivers and code frameworks when developing IoT systems. The device drivers and code frameworks within the ESP-IoT-Solution are organized as separate components, allowing them to be easily integrated into an ESP-IDF project.

ESP-IoT-Solution includes:

* Device drivers for sensors, display, audio, GUI, input, actuators, etc.
* Framework and documentation for low power, security, storage, etc.
* Guide for Espressif open source solutions from practical application point.
