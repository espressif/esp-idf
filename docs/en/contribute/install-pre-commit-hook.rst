Common Problems For Windows Users
---------------------------------

1. ``/usr/bin/env: python: Permission denied.``

   If you're in Git Bash or MSYS terminal, please check the python executable location by run ``which python``.

   If the executable is under ``~/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/``, then it's a link to Windows AppStore, not a real one.

   Please install python manually and update this in your ``PATH`` environment variable.
