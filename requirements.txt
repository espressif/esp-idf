# windows-curses are required in Windows command line but cannot be installed in MSYS2. A requirement like
# "windows-curses; sys_platform == 'win32'" would want to install the package on both of them. There is no environment
# marker for detecting MSYS2. So instead, a dummy custom package is used with "windows-curses" dependency for Windows
# command line.
