# Storage performance benchmark example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

**WARNING: This example will format both your SPI flash "storage" partition and SD card (if used)!**

This example demonstrates a benchmark of a storage media such as SPI flash memory and SD card.
Only ESP32 and ESP32-S3 targets can use SDMMC mode when connecting to a SD card.

This example provides comparison between different types of storage in terms of speed under various configurable (from menuconfig) conditions

Currently these mediums and file-systems are supported:
- SPI Flash
    - Raw access
    - FATFS
    - SPIFFS
    - LittleFS
- SDMMC/SDSPI card
    - Raw access
    - FATFS
    - LittleFS

### Comparison scheme

For each filesystem, four sets of benchmarks are run:
- Target size R/W
- More than target size R/W (about target_size x 1.2)
- Less than target size R/W (about target_size / 1.2)
- Tiny size                 (255 bytes)

Some filesystems are also tested in two modes:
- New file - new file gets created every time
- Normal - the old file gets overwritten each time (`O_TRUNC`)

Every benchmark (except SPIFFS ones) is run multiple times (can be configuredd) for better accuracy, as the results often vary between runs.
We recommend using at least `100` runs, but default is set to `10` for convenience.

### Disclaimer

While this benchmark tries to give objective results, they may vary by significant amount with different settings, especially for filesystem with large amount of compile time configuration options such as LittleFS.

### Pin assignments for SD card connection

The GPIO pin numbers used to connect an SD card can be customized using the following:

- Run `idf.py menuconfig` in the project directory and open "Performance Benchmark Example Configuration" menu.

However, pins cannot be customized when using ESP32 target in SDMMC mode (`SDMMC_HOST_SLOT_1`).

This example doesn't utilize card detect (CD) and write protect (WP) signals from SD card slot.

The table below shows the default pin assignments.

SD card pin | SPI pin | ESP32 pin     | ESP32-S2 | ESP32-S3 | ESP32-P4 SDMMC | ESP32-P4 SDSPI | ESP32-H2 | ESP32-C3 and other chips | Notes
------------|---------|---------------|----------|----------|----------------|----------------|----------|--------------------------|-------------
 D0         | MISO    | GPIO2         | GPIO37   | GPIO37   | GPIO43         | GPIO13         | GPIO0    | GPIO6                    | 10k pullup

 CLK        | SCK     | GPIO14 (MTMS) | GPIO36   | GPIO36   | GPIO41         | GPIO12         | GPIO4    | GPIO5                    | 10k pullup
 CMD        | MOSI    | GPIO15 (MTDO) | GPIO35   | GPIO35   | GPIO42         | GPIO11         | GPIO5    | GPIO4                    | 10k pullup

 ### 4-line and 1-line SD modes

By default, this example uses 4 line SD mode, utilizing 6 pins: CLK, CMD, D0 - D3. It is possible to use 1-line mode (CLK, CMD, D0) by changing "SD/MMC bus width" in the example configuration menu (see `CONFIG_EXAMPLE_SDMMC_BUS_WIDTH_1`).

Note that even if card's D3 line is not connected to the ESP chip, it still has to be pulled up, otherwise the card will go into SPI protocol mode.

### Note about GPIO2 (ESP32 only)

GPIO2 pin is used as a bootstrapping pin, and should be low to enter UART download mode. One way to do this is to connect GPIO0 and GPIO2 using a jumper, and then the auto-reset circuit on most development boards will pull GPIO2 low along with GPIO0, when entering download mode.

- Some boards have pulldown and/or LED on GPIO2. LED is usually ok, but pulldown will interfere with D0 signals and must be removed. Check the schematic of your development board for anything connected to GPIO2.

### Note about GPIO12 (ESP32 only)

GPIO12 is used as a bootstrapping pin to select output voltage of an internal regulator which powers the flash chip (VDD_SDIO). This pin has an internal pulldown so if left unconnected it will read low at reset (selecting default 3.3V operation). When adding a pullup to this pin for SD card operation, consider the following:

- For boards which don't use the internal regulator (VDD_SDIO) to power the flash, GPIO12 can be pulled high.
- For boards which use 1.8V flash chip, GPIO12 needs to be pulled high at reset. This is fully compatible with SD card operation.
- On boards which use the internal regulator and a 3.3V flash chip, GPIO12 must be low at reset. This is incompatible with SD card operation.
    * In most cases, external pullup can be omitted and an internal pullup can be enabled using a `gpio_pullup_en(GPIO_NUM_12);` call. Most SD cards work fine when an internal pullup on GPIO12 line is enabled. Note that if ESP32 experiences a power-on reset while the SD card is sending data, high level on GPIO12 can be latched into the bootstrapping register, and ESP32 will enter a boot loop until external reset with correct GPIO12 level is applied.
    * Another option is to burn the flash voltage selection efuses. This will permanently select 3.3V output voltage for the internal regulator, and GPIO12 will not be used as a bootstrapping pin. Then it is safe to connect a pullup resistor to GPIO12. This option is suggested for production use.

The following command can be used to program flash voltage selection efuses **to 3.3V**:

```sh
    components/esptool_py/esptool/espefuse.py set_flash_voltage 3.3V
```

This command will burn the `XPD_SDIO_TIEH`, `XPD_SDIO_FORCE`, and `XPD_SDIO_REG` efuses. With all three burned to value 1, the internal VDD_SDIO flash voltage regulator is permanently enabled at 3.3V. See the technical reference manual for more details.

`espefuse.py` has a `--do-not-confirm` option if running from an automated flashing script.

See [the document about pullup requirements](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/peripherals/sd_pullup_requirements.html) for more details about pullup support and compatibility of modules and development boards.

#### ESP32-P4 related notes

This only applies when `Test SD card` setting in `Performance Benchmark Example Configuration` is enabled.

On ESP32-P4, Slot 1 of the SDMMC peripheral is connected to GPIO pins using GPIO matrix. This allows arbitrary GPIOs to be used to connect an SD card. In this example, GPIOs can be configured in two ways:

1. Using menuconfig: Run `idf.py menuconfig` in the project directory and open `Performance Benchmark Example Configuration` menu.
2. In the source code: See the initialization of `sdmmc_slot_config_t slot_config` structure in the example code.

If pins selected correspond with default pins used for ESP32-P4 SDMMC (i.e. SD card slot is connected to them), possibly an additional setting up needs to be done.

These pins are able to connect to an ultra high-speed SD card (UHS-I) which requires 1.8V switching (instead of the regular 3.3V). This means the user has to provide an external LDO power supply to use them, or to enable and configure an internal LDO via `idf.py menuconfig` -> `SD/MMC Example Configuration` -> `SD power supply comes from internal LDO IO`.

When using different GPIO pins this is not required and `SD power supply comes from internal LDO IO` setting can be disabled.

### Note about SPIFFS

The test for SPIFFS is run only once, because SPIFFS has a problem with deleting files.

## How to use example

### Configure

1. Set the target chip: `idf.py set-target TARGET` (replace TARGET with ESP32 chip series name)

1. Configure the example (`idf.py menuconfig` -> "Performance Benchmark Example Configuration") whether you want to:

- Set size of data to write
- Test internal SPI flash
  - Raw access (through wear-leveling)
  - FATFS
    - Set cluster size
  - SPIFFS
  - LittleFS

- Test SD card
  - Select SD card interface
    - SDSPI
    - SDMMC
  - SD card test configuration
    - Raw access
    - FATFS
    - LittleFS
    - Set SD card frequency
    - Set GPIO pins

Some configuration options may be available for ESP32 and ESP32-S3 only.

#### Note about LittleFS

LittleFS offers many other compile time configuration options which need to be set in it's component config.
These setting will have effect on it's performance.

#### Note about FATFS

To achieve the best performance the cluster should match with the target size, and be as high as possible.
However the higher the cluster size the more space will be wasted by partially filled clusters.
Keep in mind that the cluster size needs to be a multiple of sector size for SPI-flash that's 4096 and for SD-Card it's 512.
Also, the size of the storage medium determines maximum cluster size, for that reason this example uses 2MB of flash just for the filesystem (4MB by default, for smaller cluster sizes (16k) around 1MB should be enough.

### Build and flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT build flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with serial port name.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Troubleshooting

### Failure to download the example

```
Connecting........_____....._____....._____....._____....._____....._____....._____

A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to Espressif device: Invalid head of packet (0x34)
```

Disconnect the SD card D0/MISO line from GPIO2 and try uploading again. Read "Note about GPIO2" above.

### Card fails to initialize with `sdmmc_init_sd_scr: send_scr (1) returned 0x107` error

Check connections between the card and the ESP32. For example, if you have disconnected GPIO2 to work around the flashing issue, connect it back and reset the ESP32 (using a button on the development board, or by pressing Ctrl-T Ctrl-R in IDF Monitor).

### Card fails to initialize with `sdmmc_check_scr: send_scr returned 0xffffffff` error

Connections between the card and the ESP32 are too long for the frequency used. Try using shorter connections, or try reducing the clock speed of SD interface.
