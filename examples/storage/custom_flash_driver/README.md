# Custom Flash Driver Example

This example shows how to override the default chip driver list provided by IDF. Please make sure the SPI_FLASH_OVERRIDE_CHIP_DRIVER_LIST config option is enabled when you build this project (though it should already be enabled by default via `sdkconfig.defaults`). See [the programming guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/api-reference/storage/spi_flash_override_driver.html) for more details regarding this feature.

**CAUTION: This is only an example showing how to extend your own flash chip driver. Espressif doesn't guarantee the chip driver in the example is reliable for mass production, nor the reliability of the flash models that appear in this example. Please refer to the specification of your flash chip, or contact the flash vendor if you have any problems with the flash chip.**

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

## How to use example

Follow detailed instructions provided specifically for this example.

Select the instructions depending on Espressif chip installed on your development board:

## Troubleshooting

* Program upload failure

    * Hardware connection is not correct: run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`, and reboot your board to see if there are any output logs.
    * The baud rate for downloading is too high: lower your baud rate in the `menuconfig` menu, and try again.
