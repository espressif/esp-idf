# Console Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This example illustrates the usage of the [Console Component](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/console.html#console) to create an interactive shell on the ESP32. The interactive shell running on the ESP32 can then be controlled/interacted with over a serial port (UART).

The interactive shell implemented in this example contains a wide variety of commands, and can act as a basis for applications that require a command-line interface (CLI).

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This example should be able to run on any commonly available ESP32 development board.

### Configure the project

```
idf.py menuconfig
```

* Enable/disable `Example Configuration > Store command history in flash` as necessary

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

Enter the `help` command get a full list of all available commands. The following is a sample session of the Console Example where a variety of commands provided by the Console Example are used. Note that GPIO15 is connected to GND to remove the boot log output.

## Troubleshooting

### Line Endings

The line endings in the Console Example are configured to match particular serial monitors. Therefore, if the following log output appears, consider using a different serial monitor (e.g. Putty for Windows) or modify the example's [UART configuration](#Configuring-UART-and-VFS).

```

Use UP/DOWN arrows to navigate through command history.
Press TAB when typing command name to auto-complete.
Your terminal application does not support escape sequences.
Line editing and history features are disabled.
On Windows, try using Putty instead.

## Example Breakdown

### Configuring UART

The ``initialize_console()`` function in the example configures some aspects of UART relevant to the operation of the console.

- **Line Endings**: The default line endings are configured to match those expected/generated by common serial monitor programs, such as `screen`, `minicom`, and the `esp-idf-monitor` included in the SDK. The default behavior for these commands are:
    - When 'enter' key is pressed on the keyboard, `CR` (0x13) code is sent to the serial device.
    - To move the cursor to the beginning of the next line, serial device needs to send `CR LF` (0x13 0x10) sequence.

### Line editing

The main source file of the example illustrates how to use `linenoise` library, including line completion, hints, and history.

### Commands

Several commands are registered using `esp_console_cmd_register()` function. See the `register_wifi()` and `register_system()` functions in `cmd_wifi.c` and `cmd_system.c` files.

### Command handling

Main loop inside `app_main()` function illustrates how to use `linenoise` and `esp_console_run()` to implement read/eval loop.

### Argument parsing

Several commands implemented in `cmd_wifi.c` and `cmd_system.c` use the Argtable3 library to parse and check the arguments.

### Command history

Each time a new command line is obtained from `linenoise`, it is written into history and the history is saved into a file in flash memory. On reset, history is initialized from that file.
