    config EXAMPLE_TOUCH_WAKEUP
        bool "Enable touch wake up"
        default y
        depends on !IDF_TARGET_ESP32C3 && !IDF_TARGET_ESP32S3
        help
            This option enables wake up from deep sleep using touch pads
            TOUCH8 and TOUCH9, which correspond to GPIO33 and GPIO32.

    config EXAMPLE_ULP_TEMPERATURE_WAKEUP
        bool "Enable temperature monitoring by ULP"
        default y
        depends on IDF_TARGET_ESP32
        help
            This option enables wake up from deep sleep using ULP.
            ULP program monitors the on-chip temperature sensor and
            wakes up the chip when the temperature goes outside of
            the window defined by the initial temperature and a threshold
            around it.

    config EXAMPLE_EXT0_WAKEUP
        bool "Enable wakeup from GPIO (ext0)"
        default y
        depends on !SOC_GPIO_SUPPORT_DEEPSLEEP_WAKEUP
        help
            This option enables wake up from deep sleep from GPIO3. They should be connected to LOW to avoid
            floating pins. When triggering a wake up, connect one or both of the pins to HIGH. Note that floating
            pins may trigger a wake up.

    config EXAMPLE_EXT1_WAKEUP
        bool "Enable wakeup from GPIO (ext1)"
        default y
        depends on !SOC_GPIO_SUPPORT_DEEPSLEEP_WAKEUP
        help
            This option enables wake up from deep sleep from GPIO2 and GPIO4. They should be connected to LOW to avoid
            floating pins. When triggering a wake up, connect one or both of the pins to HIGH. Note that floating
            pins may trigger a wake up.

    config EXAMPLE_EXT1_USE_INTERNAL_PULLUPS
        bool "Use internal pull-up/downs for EXT1 wakeup source"
        default n
        depends on EXAMPLE_EXT1_WAKEUP
        help
            When using EXT1 wakeup source without external pull-up/downs, you may want to make use of the internal
            ones.

            However, the RTC IO reside in the RTC Periph power domain. Enable this option to force that power domain
            ON during deep sleep. Note that this will increase some power comsumption, so it's still suggested to use
            external ones instead.

            EXT0 wakeup source resides in the same power domain as RTCIO (RTC Periph), so internal pull-up/downs are
            always available. There's no need to explicitly force it on for EXT0.

    config EXAMPLE_GPIO_WAKEUP
        bool "Enable wakeup from GPIO"
        default y
        depends on SOC_GPIO_SUPPORT_DEEPSLEEP_WAKEUP
        help
            This option enables wake up from GPIO. Be aware that if you use low level to trigger wakeup, we strongly
            recommand you to connect external pull-up resistance.

            help
                This option set the gpio wake-up trigger signal, In deep sleep, only high or low level wake-up is
                supported. If this option is enabled, it is a high level wake up, otherwise it is a low level wake up.
