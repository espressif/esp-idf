            Select storage of the base MAC address which is used to generate MAC addresses of all network interfaces
            when networking is initialized.
            If "Default (Espressif factory) eFuse BLK0" is selected, esp32 will use default base MAC address which is
            written into eFuse block 0 words 1, 2 when the chip is manufactured.
            If "Custom eFuse BLK3" is selected, ESP32 will use customer-defined base MAC address which is written into
            eFuse Block 3 words 0, 1. Users must call esp_efuse_mac_get_custom to get base MAC address and
            esp_base_mac_addr_set to set the base MAC address before network interfaces are initialised.
            If "Other external storage" is selected, esp32 will use customer-defined base MAC address from external
            storage(flash, EEPROM, etc). Users must get the base MAC address first and call esp_base_mac_addr_set to
            set the base MAC address before network interfaces are initialised.

            Select behavior when reading base MAC address from BLK3 of eFuse error.
            If "Abort" is selected, esp32 will abort.
            If "Use base MAC address from BLK3 of eFuse" is selected, esp32 will use the base MAC address which is
            written into eFuse block 0 words 1, 2 when the chip is manufactured.
