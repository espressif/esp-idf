# Example: General Purpose Timer

This example uses the timer group driver to generate timer interrupts at two specified alarm intervals.

## How to Use Example

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for all the steps to configure and use the ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

```

```

## Functionality Overview

* Two timers are configured
* Each timer is set with some sample alarm interval
* On reaching the interval value each timer will generate an alarm
* One of the timers is configured to automatically reload it's counter value on the alarm
* The other timer is configured to keep incrementing and is reloaded by the application each time the alarm happens
* Alarms trigger subsequent interrupts, that is tracked with messages printed on the terminal:
