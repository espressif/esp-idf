# HC-SR04 Example based on MCPWM Capture

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

The capture module in MCPWM peripheral is designed to accurately log the time stamp on the hardware side when an event happens (compared to GPIO ISR which requires a software-based logging method). Each capture unit has three channels, which can be used together to capture IO events in parallel.

This example shows how to make use of the hardware features to decode the pulse width signals generated from a common HC-SR04 sonar sensor -- [HC-SR04](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569).

The signal that HC-SR04 produces (and what can be handled by this example) is a simple pulse whose width indicates the measured distance. An excitation pulse is required to send to HC-SR04 on `Trig` pin to begin a new measurement. Then the pulse described above will appear on the `Echo` pin after a while.

Typical signals:

```

                       |     |
                       |     |

```

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
