    config SDIO_EXAMPLE_4BIT
        bool "Host tries using 4-bit mode to communicate with slave"
        default n
        help
            If this is set, the host tries using 4-bit mode to communicate with
            slave. If failed, the communication falls back to 1-bit mode.

            If this is not set, the host uses 1-bit mode. However, CMD1 is still
            mandatory for interrupts.

            Note that 4-bit mode is not compatible (by default) if the slave is
            using 3.3V flash which requires a pull-down on the MTDI pin.

    config SDIO_EXAMPLE_HIGHSPEED
        bool "Host tries using HS mode to communicate with slave"
        default y
        help
            If this is set, the host tries using high-speed mode to communicate
            with slave. If the slave doesn't support high-speed mode, the
            communication falls back to default-speed mode. If this is not set,
            the host uses DS mode.

            If the example does not work, please try disabling the HS mode.

    choice EXAMPLE_SLAVE
        prompt "Id of Slave used in Espressif master-slave board."
        default EXAMPLE_SLAVE_NONE
        help
            If Espressif master-slave board is used, select which slave is used.

        config EXAMPLE_SLAVE_NONE
            bool "Not using Espressif master-slave board."
        config EXAMPLE_SLAVE_B1
            bool "Using slave B1"
        config EXAMPLE_SLAVE_B2
            bool "Using slave B2"
        config EXAMPLE_SLAVE_B3
            bool "Using slave B3"
