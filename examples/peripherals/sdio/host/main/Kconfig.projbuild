    config EXAMPLE_SDIO_OVER_SPI
        bool "Host use SPI bus to communicate with slave"
        default n
        help
            If this is set, the host tries using SPI bus to communicate with slave.
            Otherwise, the standarad SD bus is used.

    config EXAMPLE_SDIO_4BIT
        bool "Host tries using 4-bit mode to communicate with slave"
        default n
        depends on !EXAMPLE_SDIO_OVER_SPI
        help
            If this is set, the host tries using 4-bit mode to communicate with
            slave. If failed, the communication falls back to 1-bit mode.

            If this is not set, the host uses 1-bit mode. However, CMD1 is still
            mandatory for interrupts.

            Note that 4-bit mode is not compatible (by default) if the slave is
            using 3.3V flash which requires a pull-down on the MTDI pin.

    config EXAMPLE_SDIO_HIGHSPEED
        bool "Host tries using HS mode to communicate with slave"
        default y
        help
            If this is set, the host tries using high-speed mode to communicate
            with slave. If the slave doesn't support high-speed mode, the
            communication falls back to default-speed mode. If this is not set,
            the host uses DS mode.

            If the example does not work, please try disabling the HS mode.

    config EXAMPLE_NO_INTR_LINE
        bool "The host is not connected to the interrupt line (DAT1) of slave"
        default n
        help
            If this is set, the host example will not check the interrupt line but poll slave
            registers to see whether the slave has interrupts for the host.

            Working without the interrupt line may increase the CPU load of the host, and do harm
            to the response speed to slave events, though can save 1 GPIO for other purposes in
            non-4-bit mode.

    choice EXAMPLE_SLAVE
        prompt "GPIO to control slave EN in Espressif master-slave board."
        default EXAMPLE_SLAVE_NONE
        help
            If Espressif master-slave board is used, select the correct GPIO to control slave's EN.

        config EXAMPLE_SLAVE_NONE
            bool "Not using Espressif master-slave board."
        config EXAMPLE_SLAVE_B1
            bool "Using slave B1"

    config EXAMPLE_SLAVE_PWR_NEGTIVE_ACTIVE
        bool "Slave power control pin is negtive active, otherwise postive active"
        depends on !EXAMPLE_SLAVE_NONE
        default n
        help
            Slave power control pin is negtive active, otherwise postive active
