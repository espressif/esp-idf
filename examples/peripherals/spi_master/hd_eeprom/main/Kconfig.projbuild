    config EXAMPLE_USE_SPI1_PINS
        bool "The example runs on SPI1 pins or some other pins"
        default n
        depends on IDF_TARGET_ESP32
        help
            Enable this option will make the EEPROM use SPI1 pins, which is shared with the main
            flash chip.

            Currently this example hasn't supported SPI1 pins on other chips yet.

    config EXAMPLE_INTR_USED
        bool "Use the interrupt to detect the eeprom busy"
        default y
        depends on !EXAMPLE_USE_SPI1_PINS
        help
            Enable this option will allow the example to be blocked while the EEPROM is working
            in progress, and unblocked by GPIO interrupt. Otherwise the example will keep polling
            until the EEPROM is idle.

    config EXAMPLE_5V_COMMANDS
        bool "The EEPROM is supplied by 5V power"
        default n
        help
            The Erase_All and Write_All commands of EEPROM are only supported when EEPROM is
            supplied by 5V power. Enable this to use those two commands.

            But please note that ESP chips don't support 5V IO, you need to add external
            level-shifting circuits between ESP chip to the EEPROM.
