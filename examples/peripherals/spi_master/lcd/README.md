# SPI Host Driver Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This example aims to show how to use SPI Host driver API, like `spi_transaction_t` and spi_device_queue. 

If you are looking for code to drive LCDs in general, rather than code that uses the SPI master, that may be a better example to look at as it uses ESP-IDFs built-in LCD support rather than doing all the low-level work itself, which can be found at `examples/peripherals/lcd/tjpgd/`

## How to Use Example

### Hardware Required

* An ESP development board, with SPI LCD

Connection :

Depends on boards. Refer to `spi_master_example_main.c` No wiring is required on ESP-WROVER-KIT

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

On ESP-WROVER-KIT there will be:

```
LCD ID: 00000000
ILI9341 detected.
LCD ILI9341 initialization.
```

At the meantime `ESP32` will be displayed on the connected LCD screen.
