# MIPI DSI LCD Panel Example

[esp_lcd](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/lcd.html) supports MIPI DSI interfaced LCD panel, with frame buffer(s) managed by the driver itself.

This example shows the general process of installing a MIPI DSI LCD driver, and displays a LVGL widget on the screen.

## How to use the example

### Hardware Required

* An ESP development board, which with MIPI DSI peripheral supported
* A general MIPI DSI LCD panel, with 2 data lanes and 1 clock lane, this example will use the [ILI9881C](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_lcd_ili9881c) for demonstration
* An USB cable for power supply and programming

### Hardware Connection

The connection between ESP Board and the LCD is as follows:

Before testing your LCD, you also need to read your LCD spec carefully, and then adjust the values like "resolution" and "blank time" in the [main](./main/mipi_dsi_lcd_example_main.c) file.

### Configure

Run `idf.py menuconfig` and go to `Example Configuration`:

* Choose whether to `Use DMA2D to copy draw buffer to frame buffer` asynchronously. If you choose `No`, the draw buffer will be copied to the frame buffer synchronously by CPU.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT build flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project. A LVGL widget should show up on the LCD as expected.

The first time you run `idf.py` for the example will cost extra time as the build system needs to address the component dependencies and downloads the missing components from registry into `managed_components` folder.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
