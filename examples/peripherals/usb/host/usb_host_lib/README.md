# USB Host Library Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the [USB Host Library API](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/api-reference/peripherals/usb_host.html) by implementing a pseudo class driver and a Host Library task. The example does the following:

1. Install Host Library and register a client
2. Waits for a device connection
3. Prints the device's information (such as device/configuration/string descriptors)
4. Waits for the device to disconnect
5. Repeats steps 2 to 4 until a user pressess a button, which quits the `app`
6. If the button has been pressed, while a USB device is still connected, the user will be prompted to remove the device and push the button again to quit the `app`
7. Deregister the client, uninstall the Host Library and quit the `app`

The example demonstrates the following aspects of the USB Host Library API:

- How to use the Library API to:
    - Install and uninstall the USB Host Library
    - Run the library event handler function and usb host library task
    - How to handle library events
- How to use the Client API from a client task to:
    - Register and deregister a client of the USB Host Library
    - Run the client event handler functions
    - How to handle client events via various callbacks
    - Open and close a device
    - Get a device's descriptors

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

An ESP board that has a push button and supports USB-OTG. The example uses the ESP's internal USB PHY, however the internal USB PHY's pins will need to be connected to a USB port (i.e., a USB breakout board) as follows:

- GND and 5V signals of the ESP board to the GND and 5V lines of the USB port
- GPIO 19 to D-
- GPIO 20 to D+

### Configure the project

```
idf.py menuconfig
```

* The USB Host Stack has a maximum supported transfer size for control transfer during device enumeration. This size is specified via the USB_HOST_CONTROL_TRANSFER_MAX_SIZE configuration option and has a default value of 256 bytes. Therefore, if devices with length config/string descriptors are used, users may want to increase the size of this configuration.
* Push button GPIO selection

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Troubleshooting

To obtain more debug, users should set the [log level](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/api-reference/system/log.html) to debug via menuconfig.

### Failing Enumeration

```
I (262) cpu_start: Starting scheduler on PRO CPU.
I (268) DAEMON: Installing USB Host Library
I (298) CLASS: Registering Client
E (2748) HUB: Short string desc corrupt
E (2748) HUB: Stage failed: CHECK_SHORT_MANU_STR_DESC
```

The log output demonstrates a device that has failed. The Hub Driver will output some error logs indicating which stage of enumeration has failed.

### Blank String Descriptors

The current USB Host Library will automatically cache the Manufacturer, Product, and Serial Number string descriptors of the device during enumeration. However, when fetching the string descriptors, the USB Host Library will only fetch those strings descriptors of they of LANGID code 0x0409 (i.e., English - United States). Therefore, if the example does not print a particular descriptor, it is likely that the string descriptor was not cached during enumeration.
