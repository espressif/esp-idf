# TinyUSB Sample Descriptor

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This example is demonstrating how to set up ESP32-S2 chip to work as a Generic USB Device with a user-defined descriptor. You can specify a manufacturer, device's name, ID and other USB-devices parameters responsible for identification by host.


As a USB stack, a TinyUSB component is used.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

- Any board with the ESP32-S2 chip

### Configure the project

There are two ways to set up a descriptor - using Menuconfig tool and in-code

#### In-code setting up

For the manual descriptor's configuration use the default example's settings and modify `tusb_sample_descriptor.c` according to your needs

#### Menuconfig

If you want to set up the desctiptor using Menuconfig UI:

1. Execute in the terminal from the example's directory: `idf.py menuconfig`

2. Turn off `Set up a USB descriptor manually in code` parameter at `Example Configuration`

3. Folow to `Component config -> TinyUSB -> Descriptor configuration` for all available configurations.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```bash
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

After the flashing you should see the output:

```
