# TCA9535 Example

 
* This example will show you how to use TCA9535 I2C I/O Expander:
 
    * read register data
    * write register data
 
* Pin assignment:
 
    * GPIO33 is assigned as the data signal of i2c slave port
    * GPIO9 is assigned as the clock signal of i2c slave port
    * GPIO39 is assigned to INT output of TCA9535. This functionality is not used in this example
