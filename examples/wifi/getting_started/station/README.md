# Wi-Fi Station Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This example shows how to use the Wi-Fi Station functionality of the Wi-Fi driver of ESP for connecting to an Access Point.

## How to use example

### Configure the project

Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`). 

In the `Example Configuration` menu:

* Set the Wi-Fi configuration.
    * Set `WiFi SSID`.
    * Set `WiFi Password`.

Optional: If you need, change the other options according to your requirements.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run the monitor tool to view the serial output:

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for all the steps to configure and use the ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output
Note that the output, in particular the order of the output, may vary depending on the environment.

Console output if station connects to AP successfully:
