# Wi-Fi Roaming Examples

This directory contains 2 example ESP-IDF projects that demonstrate the Wi-Fi Roaming capabilities. These are intended to demonstrate the Wi-Fi roaming functionality, and to provide code that you can copy and use in your own projects.

# Example Layout

* `roaming_11kvr` demonstrates the use of API's that implement IEEE 802.11kvr mechanisms.
* `roaming_app` implements Espressif's roaming app that optimally combines legacy roaming and 802.11kv based
   roaming for effective roaming.
