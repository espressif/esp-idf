# NAN Publisher Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

## Introduction
Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN) is a protocol that allows Wi-Fi devices to discover services in their proximity. NAN uses direct device-to-device communication and does not require any Internet or AP connection.
Multiple NAN devices which are in the vicinity will form a NAN cluster which allows them to communicate with each other. Devices within a NAN cluster can advertise or look for services using NAN Service Discovery protocols.
A Publisher advertises a service and a Subscriber searches for a service. A subscriber either listens passively (Passive mode) or sends out broadcast Action frames (Active mode). Similarly a publisher either broadcasts its services (Unsolicited mode) or replies to Active subscribers (Solicited Mode). Matching of services is done by service name and optionally matching filters.

## How to use example
Publishing and Subscribing is possible dynamically on the NAN Interface. For simplicity this example demonstrates only the Publish method with some configuration options. Use option `Example Configuration -> NAN Service Name` for naming the Publish service. Select `Publish Type` and optionally set the `Matching Filter` and `Reply message` in the same menu. Another device in the vicinity running the Subscriber example will discover the Publisher. A service match happens when the service name (case insensitive) matches as well as the Matching filter(s) matche(s) (case sensitive). After this the Subscriber may send a Follow-up or initiate Datapath with the Publisher for further communication. The Publisher will send a reply to the Follow-up and will accept the Datapath request given that it has enough resources.

## Example Output

Usecase 1 : Publisher with a Follow-up exchange with a Subscriber
