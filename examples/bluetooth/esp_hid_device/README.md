# ESP-IDF BT/BLE HID Device Demo

This demo use APIs which esp_hid component provided to create a BT, BLE or Bluetooth dual mode hid device. Users can choose mode by setting `HID_DEV_MODE`.


This example works in companion with the [BLE HID Host Example](../esp_hid_host/README.md)

## How to Use Example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using:

```bash
idf.py set-target <chip_name>
```
The BT hid device plays as a mouse. When the connection is successfully established, users can follow the usage below to operate the 'mouse'.

```
########################################################################
BT hid mouse demo usage:
You can input these value to simulate mouse: 'q', 'w', 'e', 'a', 's', 'd', 'h'
q -- click the left key
w -- move up
e -- click the right key
a -- move left
s -- move down
d -- move right
h -- show the help

```

The BLE hid device plays as a remote control. When the connection is successfully established, the remote control will set volume up and down periodically.
This example implements a BLE HID device.

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Configure the Project

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output.

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://idf.espressif.com/) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
