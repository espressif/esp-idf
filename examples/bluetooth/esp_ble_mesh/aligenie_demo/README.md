ESP BLE Mesh AliGenie Example
=============================

This example shows how a BLE Mesh device work with AliGenie.

For a better demonstration effect, an RGB LED can be soldered onto the ESP32-DevKitC board, by connecting their corresponding GPIO pins are GPIO\_NUM\_25, GPIO\_NUM\_26, GPIO\_NUM\_27.

Please check the [tutorial](tutorial/BLE_Mesh_AliGenie_Example.md) for more information about this example.
