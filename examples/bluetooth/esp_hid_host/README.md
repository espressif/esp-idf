# ESP-IDF BT/BLE HID Host Demo


# ESP-IDF BLE HID Host Demo

This demo use APIs which esp_hid component provided to create a Bluetooth dual mode hid host. After the program is started, the HID host will scan the surrounding Bluetooth HID device and try to connect to the last device which has been scanned. When the connection is successfully established, the HID host will dump the HID device information and can receive the data sent by the HID device.

This example works in companion with the [BLE HID Device Example](../esp_hid_device/README.md)

## How to Use Example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using:

```bash
idf.py set-target <chip_name>
```

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Configure the Project

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output.

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://idf.espressif.com/) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
