# BLE Mesh example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This example implements Bluetooth Mesh node that supports On/Off and Level models.

It has suport for both Advertising Bearer and GATT Bearer.

For more information on NimBLE MESH, please visit [NimBLE_MESH](https://mynewt.apache.org/latest/network/docs/mesh/index.html#bluetooth-mesh).

It uses ESP32's Bluetooth controller and NimBLE stack based BLE host.

This example can be starting step to get basic understanding on how to build BLE MESH node.

To test this demo, any BLE mesh provisioner app can be used.


## How to use example

### Configure the project

```
make menuconfig
```

* Set serial port under Serial Flasher Options.

* Select 'Enable BLE mesh functionality' under 'Component config > Bluetooth > Enable NimBLE host stack'.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
make -j4 flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

There is this console output on successful BLE provisioning:
