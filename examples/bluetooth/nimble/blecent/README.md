# BLE Central Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This example creates GATT client and performs passive scan, it then connects to peripheral device if the device advertises connectability and the device advertises support for the Alert Notification service (0x1811) as primary service UUID.

After connection it enables bonding and link encryprion if the `Enable Link Encryption` flag is set in the example config.

It performs six GATT operations against the specified peer:

* Reads the ANS Supported New Alert Category characteristic.

* After the read operation is completed, writes the ANS Alert Notification Control Point characteristic.

* After the write operation is completed, subscribes to notifications for the ANS Unread Alert Status characteristic.

* After the subscribe operation is completed, it subscribes to notifications for a user defined characteristic.

* After this subscribe operation is completed, it writes to the user defined characteristic.

* After the write operation is completed, it reads from the user defined characteristic.

If the peer does not support a required service, characteristic, or descriptor, then the peer lied when it claimed support for the alert notification service! When this happens, or if a GATT procedure fails, this function immediately terminates the connection.

It uses ESP32's Bluetooth controller and NimBLE stack based BLE host.

This example aims at understanding BLE service discovery, connection, encryption and characteristic operations.

To test this demo, use any BLE GATT server app that advertises support for the Alert Notification service (0x1811) and includes it in the GATT database.

Note :

* To install the dependency packages needed, please refer to the top level [README file](../../../README.md#running-test-python-script-ttfw).
* Currently this Python utility is only supported on Linux (BLE communication is via BLuez + DBus).

## How to Use Example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using:

```bash
idf.py set-target <chip_name>
```

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32/ESP32-C2/ESP32-C3/ESP32-S3 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Configure the Project

Open the project configuration menu:

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```

In the `Example Configuration` menu:

* Change the `Peer Address` option if needed.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://idf.espressif.com/) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

This is the console output on successful connection:
