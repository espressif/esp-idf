# BLE Multiple Connection Central Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

Please check the [tutorial](tutorial/Ble_Multiple_Connections_Central_Example_Walkthrough.md) for more information about this example.

## How to Use Example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using:

```bash
idf.py set-target <chip_name>
```

### Hardware Required

* At least two development board with ESP32-C6/ESP32-H2 SoC (e.g., ESP32-C6-DevKitC, ESP32-H2-DevKitC, etc.)
* USB cable for Power supply and programming

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://idf.espressif.com/) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

This is the console output on successful connection:
