# ESP-IDF BLE50 Security Server Example

This example shows how to use the APIs to connect in secure manner with peer device and use encryption for data exchange.

To test this example, you can run [ble50_security_client_demo](../ble50_security_client), which starts scanning, connects to and starts encryption with `ble50_sec_gattc_demo` automatically.

Please, check this [tutorial](tutorial/ble50_security_server_Example_Walkthrough.md) for more information about this example.

## How to Use Example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using:

```bash
idf.py set-target <chip_name>
```
There are some important points for this demo:  
1.`esp_ble_gap_set_security_param` should be used to set the security parameters in the initial stage;  
2.`esp_ble_set_encryption` should be used to start encryption with peer device. If the peer device initiates the encryption,
  `esp_ble_gap_security_rsp` should be used to send security response to the peer device when `ESP_GAP_BLE_SEC_REQ_EVT` is received.  
3.The `ble50_sec_gattc_demo` will receive a `ESP_GAP_BLE_AUTH_CMPL_EVT` once the encryption procedure has completed.  

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32-C3 SoC, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C2/ESP32-H2 SoC and BLE5.0 supoorted chips. (e.g., ESP32-C3-DevKitC-1, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://idf.espressif.com/) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
