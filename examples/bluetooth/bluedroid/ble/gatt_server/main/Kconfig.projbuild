    config EXAMPLE_CHAR_READ_DATA_LEN
        int "Length of characteristic value for Read Long support"
        default 4
        range 4 1000
        help
            Defines the length of the characteristic value used in the
            Read Characteristic Values procedure.

            If the characteristic value length exceeds (MTU - 1) bytes,
            the Read Long procedure is automatically triggered, requiring
            multiple `ATT_READ_BLOB_REQ` requests from the client to retrieve
            the full value. For details, refer to Bluetooth Core Specification
            Vol 3, Part G ยง4.8.3.

            Note: To ensure compatibility with certain smartphones,
            the Read Long response length should ideally not exceed 500 bytes.
            If a device receives more than 600 bytes, it may stop sending
            `ATT_READ_BLOB_REQ`, resulting in incomplete data reception.


    config EXAMPLE_SET_RAW_ADV_DATA
        bool "Use raw data for advertising packets and scan response data"
        help
            If this config item is set, raw binary data will be used to generate advertising & scan response data.
            This option uses the esp_ble_gap_config_adv_data_raw() and esp_ble_gap_config_scan_rsp_data_raw()
            functions.

            If this config item is unset, advertising & scan response data is provided via a higher-level
            esp_ble_adv_data_t structure. The lower layer will generate the BLE packets. This option has higher
            overhead at runtime.

    config EXAMPLE_CI_ID
        int "example id for CI test"

        help
            This config the example id for CI test. Only for internal used.

    config EXAMPLE_CI_PIPELINE_ID
        int "The pipeline id for CI test"
        default 0
        help
            This config the pipeline id for CI test. Only for internal used.
