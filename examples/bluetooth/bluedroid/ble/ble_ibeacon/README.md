# ESP-IDF iBeacon demo

From welcoming people as they arrive at a sporting event to providing information about a nearby museum exhibit, iBeacon opens a new world of possibilities for location awareness, and countless opportunities for interactivity between iOS devices and iBeacon hardware.

## Using Example 

iBeacon is a trademark of Apple Inc.

Before building devices which use iBeacon technology, visit https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/ to obtain a license.

### iBeacon Mode

This example demonstrates iBeacon-compatible BLE advertising, and scanning of iBeacons:

- **IBEACON_SENDER**: demo to send iBeacon-compatible advertising data.
 
- **IBEACON_RECEIVER**: demo to receive and resolve iBeacon advertising data.

Which demo will be run depends on the menuconfig, developers can set it in `iBeacon Example Configuration`. 

The default mode is iBeacon Sender.

### Menuconfig
Before compiling the demoï¼Œdevelopers also need to configure the project:

```c
idf.py menuconfig
```
And then enter `Component config->Bluetooth->Bluedroid Enable`

Because the number of peripherals may be very large, developers can enable the **BLE Scan Duplicate Options**, the maximum number of devices in scan duplicate filter depends on the free heap size, when the cache is full, it is cleared.

### Event Processing
In the iBeacon receiver demo, the scan result will be posted to `ESP_GAP_SEARCH_INQ_RES_EVT` event:

```c
switch (scan_result->scan_rst.search_evt) {
    case ESP_GAP_SEARCH_INQ_RES_EVT:
    /* Search for BLE iBeacon Packet */
    ......
    break;
    default:
    break;
}

```
### Build and Flash

Build each project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idp.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

The iBeacon sender will broadcast iBeacon packet after initializing the Bluetooth protocol stack, and the iBeacon receiver will scan the iBeacon packet.
