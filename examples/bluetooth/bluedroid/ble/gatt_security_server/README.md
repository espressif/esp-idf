# ESP-IDF Gatt Security Server Example

This example shows how to use the APIs to connect to and encrypt with peer devices.

To test this example, you can run [gatt_security_client_demo](../gatt_security_client), which starts scanning, connects to and starts encryption with `gatt_security_server_demo` automatically.

Please, check this [tutorial](tutorial/Gatt_Security_Server_Example_Walkthrough.md) for more information about this example.

## How to Use Example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using:

```bash
idf.py set-target <chip_name>
```
There are some important points for this demo:  
1.`esp_ble_gap_set_security_param` should be used to set the security parameters in the initial stage;  
2.`esp_ble_set_encryption` should be used to start encryption with peer device. If the peer device initiates the encryption, `esp_ble_gap_security_rsp` should be used to send security response to the peer device when `ESP_GAP_BLE_SEC_REQ_EVT` is received.  
3.The `gatt_security_client_demo` will receive a `ESP_GAP_BLE_AUTH_CMPL_EVT` once the encryption procedure has completed.  

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32/ESP32-C3/ESP32-C2/ESP32-H2/ESP32-S3 Soc (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://idf.espressif.com/) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
