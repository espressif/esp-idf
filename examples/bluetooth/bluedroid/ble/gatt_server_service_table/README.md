# ESP-IDF Gatt Server Service Table Example

This example shows how to create a GATT service with an attribute table defined in one place. Provided API releases the user from adding attributes one by one as implemented in BLUEDROID. A demo of the other method to create the attribute table is presented in [gatt_server_demo](../gatt_server).

Please, check this [tutorial](tutorial/Gatt_Server_Service_Table_Example_Walkthrough.md) for more information about this example.

## How to Use Example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using:

```bash
idf.py set-target <chip_name>
```

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32/ESP32-C3/ESP32-H2/ESP32-C2/ESP32-S3 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://idf.espressif.com/) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
