        bool "Use raw data for advertising packets and scan response data"
        help
            If this config item is set, raw binary data will be used to generate advertising & scan response data.
            This option uses the esp_ble_gap_config_adv_data_raw() and esp_ble_gap_config_scan_rsp_data_raw()
            functions.

            If this config item is unset, advertising & scan response data is provided via a higher-level
            esp_ble_adv_data_t structure. The lower layer will generate the BLE packets. This option has higher
            overhead at runtime.
