ESP-IDF Gattc and Gatts Coexistence example
==============================================

This example demonstrates the coexistence of gattc and gatts.

This example creates a GATT service and starts ADV. The ADV name is `ESP_GATTS_DEMO`, then waits to be connected. At the same time, a gatt client is created, the ADV name is `ESP_GATTS_DEMO`, the device is connected, and the data is exchanged. If the device is not found within 120 seconds, the example will stop scanning.

ESP-IDF also allows users to create a GATT service via an attribute table, rather than add attributes one by one. And it is recommended for users to use. For more information about this method, please refer to [gatt_server_service_table_demo](../gatt_server_service_table).

To test this example, you can run the [gatt_client_demo](../gatt_client), which can scan for and connect to this example automatically, and run [gatt_server_demo](../gatt_server), Waiting to be connected. They will start exchanging data once the GATT client has enabled the notification function of the GATT server.
