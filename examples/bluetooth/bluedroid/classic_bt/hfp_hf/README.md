# Hands-Free Client

This example is to show how to use the APIs of Hands-Free Client Component and the effects of them by providing a set of commands. You can use this example to communicate with a device that implements Hands-Free Audio Gateway (HF-AG) (e.g. a smartphone).

This demo sends back the audio data back to the HFP AG device, so you can hear your own voice when you link this demo with your HFP-AG device.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This example is designed to run on commonly available ESP32 development board, e.g. ESP32-DevKitC. To operate it should be connected to an AG running on a smartphone or on another ESP32 development board loaded with Hands Free Audio Gateway (hfp_ag) example from ESP-IDF.

### Configure the project

Open the project configuration menu: 

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```

### Special Configurations for HFP

#### Data Path

ESP32 HFP supports two types of audio datapath: PCM and HCI.

The default configuration is `PCM`, if you want to use `vHCI` you should configure the data path before building and downloading the binary.

- `PCM`: To use PCM, audio stream is directed from Bluetooth controller to the specific GPIO pins you set in the demo, and you should link these GPIO pins to a speaker via I2S port. The audio data will not go through the `Bluedroid`. In menuconfig, you should choose PCM in `menuconfig`:

    `Component config --> Bluetooth controller --> BR/EDR Sync(SCO/eSCO) default data path --> PCM`

    and also

    `Component config --> Bluetooth --> Bluedroid Options --> Hands Free/Handset Profile --> audio(SCO) data path --> PCM`.

- `vHCI`: To use vHCI, audio data stream will be directed from Bluetooth Controller through vHCI on ESP32 and go through the Bluedroid to the Application layer. In menuconfig, you should choose vHCI in `menuconfig`:

    `Component config --> Bluetooth controller --> BR/EDR Sync(SCO/eSCO) default data path --> HCI`

    and also

    `Component config --> Bluetooth --> Bluedroid Options --> Hands Free/Handset Profile --> audio(SCO) data path --> HCI`.

### Codec Choice

ESP32 supports two types of codec for HFP audio data: `CVSD` and `mSBC`.

`CVSD` is the default setting and is also the widely used codec for voice audio. But, `mSBC` is designed to have a better voice quality through `HFP`. To select which one is in use, we provide `Wide Band Speech` item in the `menuconfig` path:

`Component config --> Bluetooth --> Bluedroid Options --> Wide Band Speech`.

Switching on the `Wide Band Speech` means that the prefered codec is `mSBC`, but which one is actually being used also depends on the `Data Path` configuration.

- If you choose `PCM` for datapath, you can only use `CVSD` and hardware is responsible for the codec job. In the meanwhile, you cannot use `mSBC` by switching `Wide Band Speech` on, because the `mSBC` is implemented in the Bluedroid (Bluetooth Host Stack) by software.

- If you choose `vHCI` for datapath with `Wide Band Speech` on, codec job is done in the Bluedroid and mSBC is being used.

- If you choose `vHCI` for datapath with `Wide Band Speech` off, hardware is responsible for the codec job and `CVSD` is in use.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

**Note: Only after Hands-Free Profile(HFP) service is initialized and a service level connection exists between an HF Unit and an AG device, could other commands be available.**

You can type `dis` to disconnect with the connected AG device, and log prints such as:

```

```
#### Scenarios for Audio Connection

- Answer an incoming call
- Enable voice recognition
- Dial an outgoing call

#### Scenarios for Audio Disconnection

- Reject an incoming call
- Disable the voice recognition

#### Choise of Codec

ESP32 supports both CVSD and mSBC codec. HF Unit and AG device determine which codec to use by exchanging features during service level connection. The choice of codec also depends on the your configuration in `menuconfig`.

Since CVSD is the default codec in HFP, we just show the scenarios using mSBC:

- If you enable `BT_HFP_WBS_ENABLE` in `menuconfig`, mSBC will be available.
- If both HF Unit and AG support mSBC and `BT_HFP_WBS_ENABLE` is enabled, ESP32 chooses mSBC.
- If you use PCM data path, mSBC is not available.

### Answer or Reject an incoming call

#### Answer an incoming call

You can type `ac` to answer an incoming call and log prints such as:

```
Answer call

- `d <num>` Dial the specific number.
- `rd` Redial the last number.
- `dm <index>` Dial the specific indexed number in the AG memory.

For example, type `d 186xxxx5549` to make an outgoing call to `186xxxx5549` and log prints such as:

- `<btrh>` : 0 - hold current call, 1 - answer held call, 2 - end held call.

#### Volume Control

You can type `vu <tgt> <vol>` to update volume gain of speaker or microphone. The parameter should be set as follows:

- `<tgt>` : 0 - speaker, 1 - microphone.
- `<vol>` : Integer among 0 - 15.

For example, type `vu 0 9` to update the volume of speaker and log on AG prints:

```
I (43684) BT_APP_HF: APP HFP event: VOLUME_CONTROL_EVT
I (43684) BT_APP_HF: --Volume Target: SPEAKER, Volume 9
```

And also, `vu 1 9` update the volume gain of microphone and log on AG prints:

```
I (196284) BT_APP_HF: APP HFP event: DTMF_RESPONSE_EVT
I (196284) BT_APP_HF: --DTMF code is: 9.
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems, please check if the following rules are followed:

- You should type the command in the terminal according to the format described in the commands help table.
- Not all commands in the table are supported by AG device like _Hands Free Audio Gateway (hfp_ag)_ example from ESP-IDF.
- If you want to use `con` to establish a service level connection with specific AG device, you should add the MAC address of the AG device in `bt_app.c`, for example: `esp_bd_addr_t peer_addr = {0xb4, 0xe6, 0x2d, 0xeb, 0x09, 0x93};`
- Use `esp_hf_client_register_callback()` and  `esp_hf_client_init();` before establishing a service level connection.

## Example Breakdown

Due to the complexity of HFP, this example has more source files than other bluetooth examples. To show functions of HFP in a simple way, we use the Commands and Effects scheme to illustrate APIs of HFP in ESP-IDF.

- The example will respond to user command through UART console. Please go to `console_uart.c`  for the configuration details.
- For voice interface, ESP32 has provided PCM input/output signals which can be mapped to GPIO pins. So, please go to `gpio_pcm_config.c` for the configuration details.
- If you want to update the command table, please refer to `app_hf_msg_set.c`.
- If you want to update the command parse rules, please refer to `app_hf_msg_prs.c`.
- If you want to update the responses of HF Unit or want to update the log, please refer to `bt_app_hf.c`.
- Task configuration part is in `bt_app_core.c`.
