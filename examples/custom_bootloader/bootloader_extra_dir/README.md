# Bootloader extra component

(See the README.md file in the upper level for more information about bootloader examples.)

The purpose of this example is to show how to add a custom directory that contains a component to the bootloader build.

Registering extra components for the bootloader can be done thanks to the IDF property `BOOTLOADER_EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`. It can either refer to a directory that contains several components, either refer to a single component.

## Usage of this example:

Simply compile it:
```
idf.py build
```

Then flash it and open the monitor with the following command:
```
idf.py flash monitor
```

If everything went well, the bootloader should output the following message:
```
I (60) EXTRA: This function is called from an extra component
```

And finally the application will start and show the message:
```
User application is loaded and running.
```

## Organization of this example

This project contains a `main` directory that represents an application. It also has a `bootloader_components` directory that contains a component that will be compiled and linked with the bootloader. This `bootloader_components` can contain several components, each of them would be in a different directory.

The directory `extra_bootloader_components/extra_component/` contains a component that is meant to be included in the bootloader build. To do so, the CMake property `BOOTLOADER_EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS` is set from the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

Below is a short explanation of files in the project folder.
