            Security version 1 used Curve25519 key exchange for establishing
            secure session between device and client during provisioning

            Proof-of-possession can be optionally used to prove that the device is indeed
            in possession of the user who is provisioning the device. This proof-of-possession
            is internally used to generate the shared secret through key exchange.

        default "abcd1234"
        depends on USE_POP

            This erases the NVS to reset provisioned status of the device on every reboot.
            Provisioned status is determined by the Wi-Fi STA configuration, saved on the NVS.
