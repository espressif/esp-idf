# JTAG Re-enable Example

This example showcases the use of HMAC peripheral for enabling the soft-disabled JTAG interface.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This example can be executed on any development board with a supported Espressif SOC chip - possessing a built-in HMAC peripheral (see `Supported Targets` table above).

### Configure the device

To configure the device for JTAG access, follow these steps:

**Note:** Before running the jtag_example_helper.py script, make sure to install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 1:** Check JTAG status.

```bash
python jtag_example_helper.py check_jtag_status
```

If device is soft disabled, this example can re-enable it using further steps.

**Step 2:** Generate a 32 bytes HMAC key.

```bash
python jtag_example_helper.py generate_hmac_key <KEY_FILE>.bin
```

This generates a new 32-byte random HMAC key and store it in given file.

**Step 3:** Run the following command to burn the eFuse with the generated HMAC key with appropriate purpose. You can use purpose either HMAC_DOWN_ALL or HMAC_DOWN_JTAG. Check efuse summary to identify an available empty key block.

```bash
espefuse.py -p $ESPPORT burn_key <KEY_BLOCK_NO> <KEY_FILE>.bin HMAC_DOWN_ALL
```

**Step 4:** Generate token data from the HMAC key. Keep this token data handy before re-enabling JTAG access.

```bash
python jtag_example_helper.py generate_token <KEY_FILE>.bin <OUTPUT_FILE(optional)>
```
**Note**: The OUTPUT_FILE argument is optional. If provided, the token data will be stored in the specified file in either binary format (.bin) or hexadecimal format (.hex) based on the file extension. If no OUTPUT_FILE is specified, the token data will be printed to the console.

### Configure the project

Before the project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target <chip_name>`.

Key block to be used for re-enabling JTAG can be configured in the project configuration menu, under ``Example Configuration`` > ``key block to be used``. The default value is -1, indicating that the example will use the first found keys with the purpose either HMAC_DOWN_ALL or HMAC_DOWN_JTAG.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run the monitor tool to view the serial output:

```bash
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

It will open console to enter command. Refer [Re-enable & Disable JTAG](#Re-enable-&-Disable-JTAG) to know more about usage of example.

(To exit the serial monitor, type `Ctrl-]`.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

### Re-enable & Disable JTAG

#### Re-enable JTAG

This re-enables JTAG access until the next reboot or until disabled using this example. For disabling JTAG, refer [Disable JTAG](#Disable-JTAG)

**Note:** Even upon successful return, JTAG will only be enabled with a valid token_data. 

```bash
enable_jtag <token_data>
```

Console logs while re-enabling JTAG:

```bash

#### Disable JTAG

This disables the temporarily enabled JTAG access.

```bash
disable_jtag
```

Console logs while disabling JTAG:

```bash
esp32c6> disable_jtag
I (25104) jtag_re_enable: JTAG disabled temporarily
