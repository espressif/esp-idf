# Mesh IP Internal Networking example

This example demonstrates how to use mesh to create a IP capable sub-network.
As a demonstration all nodes publish their IP and their internal mesh layer to MQTT broker
and uses internal communication at the same time

## Functionality

This example uses experimental NAT feature to translate addresses/ports from an internal subnet, that is created
by the root node running a DHCP server. At the same time, the nodes communicate using low level mesh send/receive
API to exchange data, such as routing table from root to all nodes and an event notification from one node
to all other nodes in the mesh. As a demonstration, the same event is also published at the mqtt broker
on a subscribed topic, so both internal mesh_recv() notification as well as mqtt data event are to be received.

### Hardware Required

This example can be executed on any platform board, the only required interface is WiFi and connection to internet.

### Configure the project

Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`) to configure the mesh network channel, router SSID, router password and mesh softAP settings.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to multiple boards forming a mesh network, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
