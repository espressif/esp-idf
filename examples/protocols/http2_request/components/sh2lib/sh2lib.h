 * This is a thin API wrapper over nghttp2 that offers simplified APIs for usage

 * stone to quickly get started with using the HTTP/2 client. Since the focus is
 * on simplicity, not all the features of HTTP/2 are supported through this
 * wrapper. Once you are fairly comfortable with nghttp2, feel free to directly
 * use nghttp2 APIs or make changes to sh2lib.c for realising your objectives.

 * - Allowing to query response code, content-type etc in the receive callback
