# Async Requests Handlers HTTPD Server Example

The Example demonstrates how to handle multiple long running simultaneous requests
within the HTTPD server. It has the following URIs:

    1. URI \long for demonstrating async requests running in the background
    2. URI \quick for demonstrating that quick requests are still responsive
    2. URI \ index page

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-C3 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for power supply and programming

### Configure the project

```
idf.py menuconfig
```
* Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`) to configure Wi-Fi or Ethernet. See "Establishing Wi-Fi or Ethernet Connection" section in [examples/protocols/README.md](../../README.md) for more details.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
