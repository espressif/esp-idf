# Captive Portal Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This example demonstrates a simple captive portal that will redirect all DNS IP questions to point to the softAP and redirect all HTTP requests to the captive portal root page. Triggers captive portal (sign in) pop up on Android, iOS and Windows. Note that the example will not redirect HTTPS requests.

## How to Use Example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target <chip_name>`.

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-C3 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for power supply and programming
* WiFi interface

### Configure the project

Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`).

In the `Example Configuration` menu:

* Set the Wi-Fi configuration.
    * Set `SoftAP SSID`
    * Set `SoftAP Password`
    * Set `Maximal STA connections`

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
