# HTTPS Request Example

Uses APIs from `esp-tls` component to make a very simple HTTPS request over a secure connection, including verifying the server TLS certificate.

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

### Session Tickets

Session Tickets, specified in [RFC 5077](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5077) are a mechanism to distribute encrypted
session-state information to the client in the form of a ticket and a mechanism to present the ticket back to the server.  The ticket is created by a TLS server and sent to a TLS client.  The TLS client presents the ticket to the TLS server to resume a session. In TLS 1.2, this speeds up handshakes from two to one round-trip.

In ESP-IDF, this feature is supported (for both server and client) when mbedTLS is used as the SSL library.

## How to use example
Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target <chip_name>`.

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-C3 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for power supply and programming

### Configure the project

```
idf.py menuconfig
```
Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`) to configure Wi-Fi or Ethernet. See "Establishing Wi-Fi or Ethernet Connection" section in [examples/protocols/README.md](../../README.md) for more details.

#### Configuring Client Session Tickets

Note: This example has client session tickets enabled by default.

* Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`)
* In the `Component Config` -> `ESP-TLS` submenu, select the `Enable client session tickets` option.

Ensure that the server has the session tickets feature enabled.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
