# Multiple Ethernet Example
(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

## Overview

This example demonstrates basic usage of Ethernet interface and WiFi station together. The workflow of the example could be as follow:

1. Connects to both WiFi and Ethernet using common-connect component
2. Starts two tasks, one for each interface to resolve configured host name and connect to it periodically
3. Connection to host endpoint is handled by:
    - creating a socket as TCP client
    - binding it to the related interface (Ethernet of WiFi)
    - send and receive a trivial HTTP request and response

If you have a new multiple interface application to go (for example, connect to IoT cloud via Ethernet and WiFi), try this as a basic template, then add your own code.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

To run this example, you need to have one ESP32 development board integrated with an Ethernet interface, for example, ESP32-Ethernet-Kit, or just connect your ESP32-DevkitC board to a breakout board which features RMII Ethernet PHY.

### Configure the project

Enter project configuration by `idf.py menuconfig` and navigate into:

* `Example Connection Configuration` menu to choose the connection details:

    - Enter SSID and password for WiFi connection
    - Set Ethernet type and configuration for Ethernet connection
    - Note that the project is preconfigured to have both WiFi and Ethernet interface enabled by default
    - See the [README.md](../../README.md) for more details about common example connection component

* `Example Configuration` menu:

    - Set host name and port for the tcp_client to connect to

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build and flash the project..

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Troubleshooting

* When connecting using Ethernet, please consult troubleshooting described in [Ethernet common readme](../../../ethernet/README.md)
or [Ethernet documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/network/esp_eth.html).
If using Ethernet for the first time, it is recommended to start with the [Ethernet example readme](../../../ethernet/basic/README.md), which contains instructions for connecting and configuring the PHY.
Once Ethernet example obtains IP address successfully, proceed to this example.

* When connecting using Wi-Fi, please refer to the WiFi examples in [examples/wifi/getting_started/](../../../wifi/getting_started).
