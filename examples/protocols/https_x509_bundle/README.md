# HTTPS x509 Bundle Example

This example shows how to use the ESP certificate bundle utility to embed a bundle of x509 certificates and use them to
establish a simple HTTPS connection over a secure connection. The path of the certificates are specified using menuconfig.

See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.

## Example workflow
- ESP TLS is initialized with the certificate bundle option enabled.
- The application loops through the given URLs, establishing a secure TLS connection to all of them, verifying the server certificate included.

### Configure the project

* Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`)
* Configure Wi-Fi or Ethernet under "Example Connection Configuration" menu. See "Establishing Wi-Fi or Ethernet Connection" section in [examples/protocols/README.md](../README.md) for more details.
* If using a different folder than `certs` for storing certificates then update `Custom Certificate Bundle Path` under `Component config` - `mbedTLS` - `Certificate Bundle`

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
