# Performance optimization options

# The lwIP and iperf tasks have a serial dependency (i.e., iperf must wait for lwIP to process packets),
# meaning that running in multi-core mode does not significantly improve performance. Additionally,
# IRAM optimizations have a more noticeable effect in single-core mode.
# However, while a single-core configuration can enhance iperf performance in controlled or isolated
# testing scenarios, it may not be optimal for real-world applications where the system also needs to
# handle additional, non-network-related tasks. In such cases, multi-core configurations might be better
# suited for balancing workloads and ensuring overall system responsiveness.
