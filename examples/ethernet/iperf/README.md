# Ethernet iperf Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

## Overview

This example demonstrates basic usage of [iperf](https://iperf.fr/) protocol to measure the throughout/bandwidth of Ethernet.

The cli environment in the example is based on the [console component](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/console.html).

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

To run this example, it's recommended that you have an official ESP32 Ethernet development board - [ESP32-Ethernet-Kit](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/hw-reference/get-started-ethernet-kit.html). This example should also work for 3rd party ESP32 board as long as it's integrated with a supported Ethernet PHY chip. Up until now, ESP-IDF supports up to four Ethernet PHY: `LAN8720`, `IP101`, `DP83848` and `RTL8201`, additional PHY drivers should be implemented by users themselves.

Besides that, `esp_eth` component can drive third-party Ethernet module which integrates MAC and PHY and provides common communication interface (e.g. SPI, USB, etc). This example will take the **DM9051** as an example, illustrating how to install the Ethernet driver in the same manner.

#### Pin Assignment

See common pin assignments for Ethernet examples from [upper level](../README.md#common-pin-assignments).

### Software Tools Preparation

1. Install iperf tool on PC
   * Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install iperf` 
   * macOS: `brew install iperf`(if using Homebrew) or `sudo port install iperf`(if using MacPorts)
   * Windows(MSYS2): Downloads binaries from [here]( https://iperf.fr/iperf-download.php#windows)

### Configure the project

```
idf.py menuconfig
```

In addition to the common configurations for Ethernet examples from [upper level](../README.md#common-configurations), you might also need to update the default value of following configurations:

1. In the `Example Configuration` menu:
    * Enable storing history commands in flash under `Store command history in flash`.

### Build, Flash, and Run

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT build flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

### Test uplink bandwidth

* PC: run command: `iperf -u -s -i 3` to start iperf server in UDP mode, and report interval is 3 seconds.
* ESP32: run command: `iperf -u -c PC_IP -i 3 -t 30` to start iperf client in UDP mode, and the test will last 30 seconds.

## Suggestions of getting higher bandwidth

1. Higher MCU working frequency will get higher bandwidth.
2. Put frequency invoked function into IRAM via macro `IRAM_ATTR` in code.
3. Priority of iperf task may also have effect.
