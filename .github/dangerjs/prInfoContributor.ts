#### Pull request review and merge process you can expect
Espressif develops the ESP-IDF project in an internal repository (Gitlab). We do welcome contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests and pull requests via this public GitHub repository.

1. An internal issue has been created for the PR, we assign it to the relevant engineer
2. They review the PR and either approve it or ask you for changes or clarifications
3. Once the Github PR is approved, we synchronize it into our internal git repository
4. In the internal git repository we do the final review, collect approvals from core owners and make sure all the automated tests are passing
    - At this point we may do some adjustments to the proposed change, or extend it by adding tests or documentation.
5. If the change is approved and passes the tests it is merged into the \`master\` branch
6. On next sync from the internal git repository merged change will appear in this public Github repository
